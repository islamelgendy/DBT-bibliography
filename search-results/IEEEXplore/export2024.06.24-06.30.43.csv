While some researchers argue that ML software requires new concepts and perspectives for testing, our analysis highlights that, at a fundamental level, the specification and testing of a software component are not dependent on the development process used or on implementation details. Although the software engineering/computer science (SE/CS) and Data Science/ML (DS/ML) communities have developed different expectations, unique perspectives, and varying testing methods, they share clear commonalities that can be leveraged. We argue that both areas can learn from each other, and a non-dual perspective could provide novel insights not only for testing ML but also for testing traditional software. Therefore, we call upon researchers from both communities to collaborate more closely and develop testing methods and tools that can address both traditional and ML software components. While acknowledging their differences has merits, we believe there is great potential in working on unified methods and tools that can address both types of software.",2159-4848,979-8-3503-3335-0,10.1109/ICSTW58534.2023.00025,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10132221,Software Testing;Software Engineering;Machine Learning;Non-Duality;Software Boundaries,Software testing;Conferences;Machine learning;Software;Testing,,,,12,IEEE,29 May 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

Particularly, diversity-based testing (DBT) has shown promising and competitive results to improve test effectiveness. However, the technical and practical challenges of introducing test prioritisation in CI pipelines are rarely discussed, thus hindering the applicability and adoption of those proposed techniques. This research builds on our prior work in which we evaluated diversity-based techniques in an industrial setting. This work investigates the factors that influence the adoption of DBT both in connection to improvements in test cost-effectiveness, as well as the process and human related challenges to transfer and use DBT prioritisation in CI pipelines. We report on a case study considering the CI pipeline of Axis Communications in Sweden. We performed a thematic analysis of a focus group interview with senior practitioners at the company to identify the challenges and perceived benefits of using test prioritisation in their test process. Our thematic analysis reveals a list of ten challenges and seven perceived effects of introducing test prioritisation in CI cycles. For instance, our participants emphasized the importance of introducing comprehensible and transparent techniques that instill trust in its users. Moreover, practitioners prefer techniques compatible with their current test infrastructure (e.g., test framework and environments) in order to reduce instrumentation efforts and avoid disrupting their current setup. In conclusion, we have identified tradeoffs between different test prioritisation techniques pertaining to the technical, process and human aspects of regression testing in CI.

However, DNNs can exhibit erroneous behaviours that may lead to critical errors, especially when used in safety-critical systems. Inspired by testing techniques for traditional software systems, researchers have proposed neuron coverage criteria, as an analogy to source code coverage, to guide the testing of DNNs. Despite very active research on DNN coverage, several recent studies have questioned the usefulness of such criteria in guiding DNN testing. Further, from a practical standpoint, these criteria are white-box as they require access to the internals or training data of DNNs, which is often not feasible or convenient. Measuring such coverage requires executing DNNs with candidate inputs to guide testing, which is not an option in many practical contexts. In this paper, we investigate diversity metrics as an alternative to white-box coverage criteria. For the previously mentioned reasons, we require such metrics to be black-box and not rely on the execution and outputs of DNNs under test. To this end, we first select and adapt three diversity metrics and study, in a controlled manner, their capacity to measure actual diversity in input sets. We then analyze their statistical association with fault detection using four datasets and five DNNs. We further compare diversity with state-of-the-art white-box coverage criteria. As a mechanism to enable such analysis, we also propose a novel way to estimate fault detection in DNNs. Our experiments show that relying on the diversity of image features embedded in test input sets is a more reliable indicator than coverage criteria to effectively guide DNN testing. Indeed, we found that one of our selected black-box diversity metrics far outperforms existing coverage criteria in terms of fault-revealing capability and computational time. Results also confirm the suspicions that state-of-the-art coverage criteria are not adequate to guide the construction of test input sets to detect as many faults as possible using natural inputs.",1939-3520,,10.1109/TSE.2023.3243522,General Motors and Canada Research Chair; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041782,Coverage;deep neural network;diversity;faults;test,Measurement;Testing;Feature extraction;Closed box;Fault detection;Neurons;Computational modeling,,17,,93,CCBY,9 Feb 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,

Depressingly, the long testing time and high testing costs make regression testing very expensive. Test case prioritization (TCP) stands out as one of the extensively researched regression testing techniques. It prioritizes test cases to optimize their execution order, aiming to maximize the prioritization goals and reveal faults earlier to provide feedback to testers. The TCP technique based on log analysis (LogTCP) designs the prioritization strategy using logs generated during test case execution. However, LogTCP’s performance is limited by its inability to incorporate the diversity of test cases for sorting. To overcome these concerns, we propose a method to implement TCP using k-means clustering and log analysis(called KL-TCP), that takes into account both log information and test case diversity. We examine the effectiveness of this strategy in ten open source Java projects on GitHub. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms LogTCP method by detecting a higher average percentage of faults.

This increases the (already high) cost of test execution. Manually identifying similar test cases is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to identify similar test cases. Our approach uses a combination of text embedding, text similarity and clustering techniques to identify similar test cases. We evaluate five different text embedding techniques, two text similarity metrics, and two clustering techniques to cluster similar test steps and three techniques to identify similar test cases from the test step clusters. Through an evaluation in an industrial setting, we showed that our approach achieves a high performance to cluster test steps (an F-score of 87.39%) and identify similar test cases (an F-score of 86.13%).

Test suite reduction aims to eliminate some test cases to reduce the test suite size and therefore reduce the cost of running it. In this paper, string distances on the text of the test cases are used as measures of similarity for reduction. A practical benefit of using string distance is that there is no need to run the test cases: the test suite source code is the only requirement, making the approach fast. We reduce test suites generated from Randoop and EvoSuite; two well-known test generation tools of Java programs. We implemented a string-based similarity reduction and compared it against random reduction. In the experiments, mutation scores using reduced test suites based on maximising string dissimilarity of test cases were higher than those for random reduction in over 70% of the test suites generated Also, the results showed that test suites generated by Randoop can be drastically reduced in one case by 99% using the string-based similarity reduction approach while maintaining the fault-finding capabilities of the original test suite. Finally, on average, the normalised compression distance was found to be the best similarity metric choice in terms of fault-detection.

Research shows that racial and gender minority groups are more likely to experience micro-inequities, and that micro-inequities have a significant negative effect on self-esteem, work performance and career advancement. However, research on micro-inequities among software practitioners, particularly with an immigration perspective, is non-existent. To bridge this gap, we investigate the experiences of software practitioners, regarding micro-inequities from an immigration perspective. We surveyed 135 immigrant and non-immigrant software practitioners working in technical roles about verbal, nonverbal and environmental micro-inequities. Our results show that immigrants experience nine out of 27 investigated forms of micro-inequities significantly more than non-immigrants. These include not being given credit for their work, feeling excluded from key social or networking opportunities and being assumed to be less competent, assertive or intelligent. Our study can serve as an incentive for practitioners to adopt (more) inclusive work practices and to raise awareness about micro-inequities in the community.Lay Abstract: Micro-inequities are subtle, repetitive, and often unintentional forms of negative messaging, that can account for a significant burden over time.

Among the software validation and verification practices, testing for functional fault detection is a convenient way to build trustworthiness in the learned decision model. While recent works seek to maximise the number of detected faults, none consider fault characterisation during the search for more diversity. We argue that policy testing should not find as many failures as possible (e.g., inputs that trigger similar car crashes) but rather aim at revealing as informative and diverse faults as possible in the model. In this paper, we explore the use of quality diversity optimisation to solve the problem of fault diversity in policy testing. Quality diversity (QD) optimisation is a type of evolutionary algorithm to solve hard combinatorial optimisation problems where high-quality diverse solutions are sought. We define and address the underlying challenges of adapting QD optimisation to the test of action policies. Furthermore, we compare classical QD optimisers to state-of-the-art frameworks dedicated to policy testing, both in terms of search efficiency and fault diversity. We show that QD optimisation, while being conceptually simple and generally applicable, finds effectively more diverse faults in the decision model, and conclude that QD-based policy testing is a promising approach.CCS CONCEPTS • Software and its engineering $\rightarrow$ Software verification and validation; • Computing methodologies $\rightarrow$ Reinforcement learning.",2833-9061,979-8-4007-0588-5,,Ministry of Education; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556424,Software Testing;Reinforcement Learning;Quality Diversity,Space vehicles;Fault detection;Sociology;Reinforcement learning;Vehicle crash testing;Automobiles;Task analysis,,,,31,,18 Jun 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

Diversity is measured on test specifications to convey how different test cases are from one another. However, there is little research on the trade-off of diversity measures based on different types of text-based specification (lexicographical or semantics). Particularly because the text content in test scripts vary widely from unit (e.g., code) to system-level (e.g., natural language). This paper compares and evaluates the cost-effectiveness in coverage and failures of different text-based diversity measures for different levels of tests. We perform an experiment on the test suites of 7 open source projects on the unit level, and 2 industry projects on the integration and system level. Our results show that test suites prioritised using semantic-based diversity measures causes a small improvement in requirements coverage, as opposed to lexical diversity that showed less coverage than random for system-level artefacts.

The software faults are detected in the stress, computational faults, faults in syntax, capacity, load balance, and so on. It is the need of the hour to detect the faults effectively and precisely, but predicting the software faults remained a challenge.

These limitations are particularly evident for perception systems based on LiDAR sensors, which have emerged as a crucial component in modern autonomous systems due to their ability to provide a 3D scan of the world and operate in all lighting conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach for testing LiDAR-based perception systems by leveraging existing real-world data as a basis to generate realistic and diverse test cases through mutations that preserve realism invariants while generating inputs rarely found in existing data sets, and automatically crafting oracles that identify potentially safety-critical issues in perception performance.

Hence, test case (suite) minimization is used to remove redundant test cases that are unlikely to detect new faults. However, most test case minimization techniques rely on code coverage (white-box), model-based features, or requirements specifications, which are not always (entirely) accessible by test engineers. Code coverage analysis also leads to scalability issues, especially when applied to large industrial systems. Recently, a set of novel techniques was proposed, called FAST-R, relying solely on test case code for test case minimization, which appeared to be much more efficient than white-box techniques. However, it achieved a comparable low fault detection capability for Java projects, thus making its application challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose ATM (AST-based Test case Minimizer), a similarity-based, search-based test case minimization technique, taking a specific budget as input, that also relies exclusively on the source code of test cases but attempts to achieve higher fault detection through finer-grained similarity analysis and a dedicated search algorithm. ATM transforms test case code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and relies on four tree-based similarity measures to apply evolutionary search, specifically genetic algorithms, to minimize test cases. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of ATM on a large dataset of 16 Java projects with 661 faulty versions using three budgets ranging from 25% to 75% of test suites. ATM achieved significantly higher fault detection rates (0.82 on average), compared to FAST-R (0.61 on average) and random minimization (0.52 on average), when running only 50% of the test cases, within practically acceptable time (1.1 - 4.3 hours, on average, per project version), given that minimization is only occasionally applied when many new test cases are created (major releases).

Industrial software developed using C is often more complex than the object-oriented software used in these studies.

In an iterative design flow, repeated ATPG to evaluate the testability of a design after design changes have been made creates a bottleneck. The goal of this article is to address this bottleneck considering two-cycle tests for transition faults. The test generation procedure described in third article transforms an LOC test set generated for an earlier version of the design into an LOC test set for a new version without repeating the entire test generation process. To enable the transformation, it is necessary to find a mapping between the inputs and outputs of the earlier and new versions of the design, taking into consideration that RTL resynthesis may produce a new gate-level netlist, with new signal names and different input and output orders. To address two-cycle tests, the mapping is performed over two time frames of the design.

Although still in its infancy, AV technology is becoming increasingly common and could radically transform our transportation system and by extension, our economy and society. As a result, there is tremendous global enthusiasm for research, development, and deployment of AVs, e.g., self-driving taxis and trucks from Waymo and Baidu. The current practice for testing AVs uses virtual tests—where AVs are tested in software simulations—since they offer a more efficient and safer alternative compared to field operational tests. Specifically, search-based approaches are used to find particularly critical situations. These approaches provide an opportunity to automatically generate tests; however, systematically creating valid and effective tests for AV software remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce scenoRITA, a test generation approach for AVs that uses an evolutionary algorithm with (1) a novel gene representation that allows obstacles to be fully mutable, hence, resulting in more reported violations and more diverse scenarios, (2) 5 test oracles to determine both safety and motion sickness-inducing violations and (3) a novel technique to identify and eliminate duplicate tests.

To test DNNs, diverse inputs are needed to trigger mis-predictions. Some preliminary works use byte-level mutations or domain-specific filters (e.g., foggy), whose enabled mutations may be limited and likely error-prone. State-of-the-art (SOTA) works employ deep generative models to generate (infinite) inputs. Also, to keep the mutated inputs perceptually valid (e.g., a cat remains a “cat” after mutation), existing efforts rely on imprecise and less generalizable heuristics. This study revisits two key objectives in media input mutation — perception diversity (Div) and validity (Val) — in a rigorous manner based on manifold, a well-developed theory capturing perceptions of high-dimensional media data in a low-dimensional space. We show important results that Div and Val inextricably bound each other, and prove that SOTA generative model-based methods fundamentally fail to mutate real-world media data (either sacrificing Div or Val). In contrast, we discuss the feasibility of mutating real-world media data with provably high Div and Val based on manifold. Following, we concretize the technical solution of mutating media data of various formats (images, audios, text) via a unified manner based on manifold. Specifically, when media data are projected into a low-dimensional manifold, the data can be mutated by walking on the manifold with certain directions and step sizes. When contrasted with the input data, the mutated data exhibit encouraging Div in the perceptual traits (e.g., lying vs. standing dog) while retaining reasonably high Val (i.e., a dog remains a dog). We implement our techniques in DeepWalk for testing DNNs. DeepWalk constructs manifolds for media data offline. In online testing, DeepWalk walks on manifolds to generate mutated media data with provably high Div and Val. Our evaluation tests DNNs executing various tasks (e.g., classification, self-driving, machine translation) and media data of different types (image, audio, text). DeepWalk outperforms prior methods in terms of the testing comprehensiveness and can find more error-triggering inputs with higher quality.

An analysis of which challenges in software engineering teams are most frequent is still missing. As teams are more international, it is more frequent that their members have different human values as well as different communication habits. Additionally, virtual team setups (working geographically separated, remote communication using digital tools and frequently changing team members) are increasingly prevalent. Objective: We aim to provide a starting point for a theory about contemporary human challenges in teams and their causes in software engineering. To do so, we look to establish a reusable set of challenges and start out by investigating the effect of team virtualization. Virtual teams often use digital communication and consist of members with different nationalities that may have more divergent human values due to cultural differences compared to single nationality teams. Method: We designed a survey instrument and asked respondents to assess the frequency and criticality of a set of challenges, separated in context ”within teams” as well as ”between teams and clients”, compiled from previous empirical work, blog posts, and pilot survey feedback. For the team challenges, we asked if mitigation measures were already in place to tackle the challenge. Respondents were also asked to provide information about their team setup. The survey included the Personal Value Questionnaire to measure Schwartz human values. Finally, respondents were asked if there were additional challenges at their workplace. The survey was first piloted and then distributed to professionals working in software engineering teams via social networking sites and personal business networks. Result: In this article, we report on the results obtained from 192 respondents. We present a set of challenges that takes the survey feedback into account and introduce two categories of challenges; ”interpersonal” and ”intrapersonal”. We found no evidence for links between human values and challenges. We found some significant links between the number of distinct nationalities in a team and certain challenges, with less frequent and critical challenges occurring if 2-3 different nationalities were present compared to a team having members of just one nationality or more than three. A higher degree of virtualization seems to increase the frequency of some human challenges, which warrants further research about how to improve working processes when teams work from remote or in a distributed fashion. Conclusion: We present a set of human challenges in software engineering that can be used for further research on causes and mitigation measures, which serves as our starting point for a theory about causes of contemporary human challenges in software engineering teams. We report on evidence that a higher degree of virtualization of teams leads to an increase of certain challenges. This warrants further research to gather more evidence and test countermeasures, such as whether the employment of virtual reality software incorporating facial expressions and movements can help establish a less detached way of communication.",1939-3520,,10.1109/TSE.2022.3148539,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706331,Software engineering;human challenges;virtual teams;human values;diversity;survey research,Software engineering;Software;Virtualization;Virtual groups;Cultural differences;Human factors;Productivity,,6,,56,IEEE,7 Feb 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,

In this poster/demo, we present an agile and cost-effective approach for satisfying the performance requirements of microservice software systems without incurring extra costs on the service provider. We research how performance, i.e., response time, can be tamed by applying software diversity, aka multi-versioning, to the system's resource-heavy critical services.

Since the effectiveness of CPS model generators heavily relies on suitable generator configurations, existing approaches randomize configurations or infer configurations with historical bug information to generate diverse bug-triggering CPS models. However, these approaches are designed for general-purpose compilers (e.g., GCC), which have two challenges when testing Simulink compiler, namely, the CPS model representation challenge on representing CPS models for diversity measurement and the configuration learning challenge on learning configurations to generate diverse CPS models. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement lEarning-based COnfiguRation Diversification (RECORD), a new configuration diversification approach. RECORD has a feature vectorization component, which addresses the first challenge by representing CPS models as feature vectors to capture the local and global characteristics of CPS models for diversity measurement.

However, most search-based methods encounter the mode collapse problem, leading to the generation of similar concrete scenarios for a given logical scenario. Besides, they require training different models for potentially diverse logical scenarios, which consume considerable time. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Stacked Action Blocks (SAB) framework inspired by reusable modularity in software architecture. In this framework, we extract atomic actions from logical scenarios and train each atomic action using a multimodal model as an action block to mitigate the impact of mode collapse. By reusing these trained action blocks, we compose diverse critical scenarios, thereby reducing training costs. We extensively evaluated our approach in four complex driving scenarios and achieved superior performance in the Critical Scenario Generation (CSG) task compared to heuristic methods and search-based methods. We demonstrate that the independent training of these action blocks that are reusable and modular is an effective way to find diverse multimodal critical driving scenarios.

Like “traditional” software, DL systems are not immune to faults, some of which may even cause catastrophic disasters. As a mainstream testing technique for DL systems, fuzzing attempts to generate a large amount of semirandom yet syntactically valid test cases, from which the so-called adversarial inputs can be found, indicating the detection of faults. Test cases in fuzzing are generated based on a seed queue, which is constructed by randomly selecting seeds from the existing test suite (that is, the set of test cases). In this article, we propose a diversity-driven approach, namely DFuzzer, for constructing seed queues in fuzzing. We particularly develop two algorithms, namely DFuzzer-IB and DFuzzer-FB, based on the information theory and deep features, respectively, to improve the diversity of seed queues. Experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the proposed techniques based on five fuzzers, three datasets, and seven DL models. The experimental results show that both strategies can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art fuzzers for DL, including DeepXplore, DLFuzz, Tensorfuzz, DeepHunter, and DeepSmartFuzzer, not only in terms of finding more adversarial inputs for triggering faults but also achieving higher coverage.

Syntactic Versus Semantic Similarity of Artificial and Real Faults in Mutation Testing Studies,M. Ojdanic; A. Garg; A. Khanfir; R. Degiovanni; M. Papadakis; Y.

Central to these techniques lies the hypothesis that artificially seeded faults involve some form of realistic properties and thus provide realistic experimental results. In an attempt to strengthen realism, a recent line of research uses machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and Natural Language Processing, to seed faults that look like (syntactically) real ones, implying that fault realism is related to syntactic similarity. This raises the question of whether seeding syntactically similar faults indeed results in semantically similar faults and, more generally whether syntactically dissimilar faults are far away (semantically) from the real ones. We answer this question by employing 4 state-of-the-art fault-seeding techniques (PiTest - a popular mutation testing tool, IBIR - a tool with manually crafted fault patterns, DeepMutation - a learning-based fault seeded framework and $\mu$μBERT - a mutation testing tool based on the pre-trained language model CodeBERT) that operate in a fundamentally different way, and demonstrate that syntactic similarity does not reflect semantic similarity.

Coverage-guided fuzzing aims to improve code coverage by generating offspring test cases through mutation, executing the program under test, and retaining interesting seeds for subsequent mutations using customized genetic algorithms. However, existing fuzzing tools rarely consider the similarity between seeds during mutation. Mutating similar seeds frequently generates similar offspring test cases, which results in similar coverage and reduces the efficiency of fuzz testing. To alleviate the impact of this problem on fuzz testing, this paper proposes a fuzz testing method based on seed diversity analysis, which focuses on the characteristics of seeds and uses byte sequences as a feature to measure the similarity between seeds. It collects seeds that can cover new edges and constructs a shorter seed queue with significant differences based on this feature, which replaces the original seed queue for mutation. Based on the proposed method, we implement the prototype tools AFL-Varied and Neuzz-Varied.

While assuring their safety and reliability is, thus, of great importance, it is also a huge challenge. Metamorphic testing (MT) has been shown to be one of the most successful testing techniques to validate automated driving systems (ADS) underpinning the AV. Having said that, there are still lots of rooms for further improving the ADS testing with MT. On one hand, the non-determinism in ADS’ behaviors poses great challenges for precisely judging their correctness. On the other hand, the testing scenarios used in the existing studies are still not very much complex for mimicking various realistic traffic conditions. In this study, we propose a new framework which takes into account the hypothesis testing to provide a more solid way for judging the non-deterministic behaviors of test outcomes. On top of that, we develop a new toolkit to implement more complex and realistic ADS testing scenarios. To demonstrate its practicability, we design complex traffic scenarios and pay attention to examine the ADS’ behaviors in non-collision cases which are often unable to be detected by conventional testing methods. It is then applied to test Autoware, a state-of-the-art modular ADS using the Carla simulator. An analysis of results with the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and Cohen’s d values reveals a large number of consistencies and reliability issues of Autoware.

Existing works testing episodic decision-making models are not workable, since they neglect the nature of sequentiality and interactivity in MDP. While other works testing sequential decision-making models are challenged by low testing efficiency because the interaction of MDP is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an optimized fuzzing framework SeqDivFuzz which infers the sequence diversity during the MDP interaction process to effectively and efficiently test sequential decision-making models in blackbox settings. It adapts the existing fuzzing framework, including Seed Selection, Seed Mutation, Feedback Analysis and integrating a module of Diversity Inference to accelerate the fuzzing procedure. The module learns historical in-process information to check the diversity of test cases when running up to checkPoint in the course of MDP, and early terminating those non-diverse ones. We conduct experimental evaluation with four models involving three simulation environments. The results reflect that SeqDivFuzz exposes 12.3%~49.1% more crashes during a 12-hour testing procedure in four pairs of models and environments compared with the state-of-the-art fuzzing framework.

This mechanism diversifies the target software into heterogeneous variants, making a specific attack chain unfeasible for the transformed variants. Enhancing the heterogeneity of these variants is important for this method to reach its expected security level. Additionally, limiting their execution overhead is necessary to ensure the availability of this protection. However, finding the optimal subset among a large number of diversified variants is computationally difficult. This creates a dilemma in software diversification schema where enhancing heterogeneity and reducing execution overhead are both desired.To ensure a determined code quality control in generating software variants, we propose a guided software diversification mechanism (called GuiDiv). GuiDiv formalizes the iterate-used transformations into a branching process of a tree (called DivTree) and introduces an optimization process (called nodemerging) to guide the diversification. The optimizer evaluates the intermediate compilation results using multi-target evaluation functions in each iteration. This process aims to optimize the contribution of structural heterogeneity from redundant instructions, allowing variants with higher structural dissimilarity and lower overhead to have a higher chance of participating in the next iteration. We developed a proof-of-concept compilation module and used OpenSSL as the performance benchmark. In the evaluations, compared to related schemes, GuiDiv can bring higher control flow dissimilarity in most test cases. Regarding the variant heterogeneity, variants generated by GuiDiv exhibit significantly lower execution overhead.",2324-9013,979-8-3503-8199-3,10.1109/TrustCom60117.2023.00073,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10538815,internet of things;code-reuse attack;code randomization;guided software diversification,Codes;Limiting;Merging;Software algorithms;Quality control;Software;Security,,,,46,IEEE,29 May 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

First, most existing approaches focus only on the end results, namely, increasing the success rate of BCSA, by adopting uninterpretable machine learning. Moreover, they utilize their own benchmark, sharing neither the source code nor the entire dataset. Finally, researchers often use different terminologies or even use the same technique without citing the previous literature properly, which makes it difficult to reproduce or extend previous work.

Given the use of ICSs in critical infrastructure, it is important to test their resilience against manipulations of sensor/actuator inputs. Unfortunately, existing methods fail to test them comprehensively, as they typically focus on finding the simplest-to-craft manipulations for a testing goal, and are also unable to determine when a test is simply a minor permutation of another, i.e. based on the same causal events. In this work, we propose a guided fuzzing approach for finding 'meaningfully different’ tests for an ICS via a general formalisation of sensor/actuator-manipulation strategies.

Several studies have focused more on measuring the accuracy aspect of the recommendation system. In comparison, there is an aspect of the recommendation system besides accuracy, namely diversity. Diversity is an aspect that plays a role in providing various recommendations based on users and content on the platform. Evaluation of the diversity aspect of the recommendation system is carried out by implementing the K-means clustering and cosine similarity algorithms using a film dataset. Then, measure it using the Intra-list diversity metric and get a result of 0.65.

Complex applications demand the full performance of commercial high performance multi-core systems of-the-shelf (COTS), with or without accelerators. While these systems are optimized for performance, hard real-time requirements and deterministic timing behavior are major constraints for safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, infrequent timing outliers caused by interleaved hardware-software effects of COTS systems complicate traditional worst-case design. This conflict often prohibits deploying COTS hardware and consequently prevents sophisticated applications, too. Recently, an approach called Timing Diversity was introduced, which proposes to exploit existing dual modular redundant hardware platforms to mask deadline violations. This paper puts Timing Diversity on a theoretical foundation and provides specification for different implementations. It demonstrates that Timing Diversity needs fast recovery to be effective, proposes a recovery strategy and provides a mathematical model for the reliability of the resulting system.

However, real-world service environments involve impacts at various angles that can lead to different failure mechanisms in solder joints. In this study, we investigate the impact reliability of microbump interconnect structures under different impact angles. By considering plastic strain analysis, we demonstrate that drop impacts at other angles can be equivalently represented by the scenario with drop angle  $\alpha =$  0° impact. Subsequently, we analyze the failure mechanism of microbumps during drop tests and propose a predictive model for their drop life under varying impact angles.

Existing works usually assume that the query function and target function share equal semantics and compare their full semantics to obtain the similarity. However, we find that the function mapping is more complex, especially when function inlining happens. In this paper, we will systematically investigate cross-inlining binary function similarity detection. We first construct a cross-inlining dataset by compiling 51 projects using 9 compilers, with 4 optimizations, to 6 architectures, with 2 inlining flags, which results in two datasets both with 216 combinations. Then we construct the cross-inlining function mappings by linking the common source functions in these two datasets. Through analysis of this dataset, we find that three cross-inlining patterns widely exist while existing work suffers when detecting cross-inlining binary function simi-larity. Next, we propose a pattern-based model named CI-Detector for cross-inlining matching. CI-Detector uses the attributed CFG to represent the semantics of binary functions and GNN to embed bi-nary functions into vectors. CI-Detector respectively trains a model for these three cross-inlining patterns. Finally, the testing pairs are input to these three models and all the produced similarities are aggregated to produce the final similarity. We conduct several experiments to evaluate CI-Detector.

In this research, we propose new methods that extract features at a higher speed and detect similarities across different architectures with higher accuracy than existing methods for basic block feature extraction using neural machine translation models. We assume that the intermediate representation of the NMT model, which learned the translation of basic blocks across different architectures, includes the semantics of the instructions in the basic block. Hence we adopted the intermediate representation as the features of the basic blocks. Then, we applied the linear transformation used in bilingual word embedding to match the embedding space of basic blocks across different architectures. This enables the similarity detection in basic block units across different architectures with higher accuracy than the distance learning method used in existing research to match the embedding space. In the evaluation experiment, we compare the Precision at k (P@k) on the same dataset with existing research methods and our method achieved the highest accuracy of 92%.

Using five real-world traffic sign datasets, we confirm that the three-version architecture effectively enhances system reliability by applying diverse models and diversified input images. Then, we estimate the diversity parameters and apply them to variants of reliability prediction models. The prediction residuals between the observed reliability and the predicted reliability are mostly less than 0.017 across all data sets, which is half of the residual achieved by the conventional prediction model, except for the architecture of a single model with triple input.

When two adjacent objective vectors are similar but the difference in the corresponding decision vectors is large, it is difficult to transfer from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. In this article, we argue that the key to overcoming this difficulty is the evaluation assignment for different subproblems based on local density and global utility. We propose a local-density measurement model to estimate the solution density around each subproblem. Based on the model, a local-diversity evaluation assignment strategy for the decomposition-based MOEA is designed to assign fitness evaluations among different subproblems. Two discrete MOPs are selected as test instances for experiments because they satisfy the premise that the difference in the corresponding decision vectors of adjacent objective vectors is large. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy enhances the population diversity. Besides, the combination of the proposed strategy and the evaluation assignment for high global utility subproblems can overcome the difficulty in transferring from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems.

However, with real-time streaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question: What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics.

More specifically, by treating the DNN as a program and each neuron as a functional point of the code, during the network training we aim to improve the generalization capability by maximizing the neuron coverage of DNN with the gradient similarity regularization between the original and augmented samples. As such, the decision behavior of the DNN is optimized, avoiding the arbitrary neurons that are deleterious for the unseen samples, and leading to the trained DNN that can be better generalized to out-of-distribution samples.

However, the complexity of highway interchanges becomes the bottleneck for their deployment. An AV should be sufficiently tested under different highway interchanges, which is still challenging due to the lack of available datasets containing diverse highway interchanges. In this paper, we propose a model-driven method, Flyover, to generate a dataset of diverse interchanges with measurable diversity coverage. First, Flyover uses a labeled digraph to model interchange topology. Second, Flyover takes real-world interchanges as input to guarantee topology practicality and extracts different topology equivalence classes by classifying corresponding topology models. Third, for each topology class, Flyover identifies the corresponding geometrical features for the ramps and generates concrete interchanges using k-way combinatorial coverage and differential evolution. To illustrate the diversity and applicability of the generated interchange dataset, we test the built-in traffic flow control algorithm in SUMO and the fuel-optimization trajectory tracking algorithm deployed to Alibaba's autonomous trucks on the dataset. The results show that except for the geometrical difference, the interchanges are diverse in throughput and fuel consumption under the traffic flow control and trajectory tracking algorithms, respectively.",,979-8-3503-2365-8,10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160868,Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160868,,Road transportation;Trajectory tracking;Roads;Urban areas;Feature extraction;Throughput;Topology,,2,,24,IEEE,4 Jul 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

These tests require students to give brief theoretical responses to the questions. Evaluation of subjective responses is based on the presence of certain facts, keywords, phrases that need to be mentioned. Traditional assessment of these tests requires an examiner to affirm the understanding of concepts by students through their answers. The human-dependant evaluation, however, is tedious, time consuming and is rarely impartial. The time constraints often mean that the examiner is unable to provide a detailed feedback to each and every student. This calls for the need to develop an objective automated grader system, which can investigate and analyze the student performances by considering different facets of learning based on semantic similarity. The enhanced BERT model, which has been fine-tuned, is utilized to capture the semantic characteristics found in the student’s response. In order to achieve this, the model compares the student’s response with the model answer and generates a model score based on the comparison. This model score is boosted through a keyword matching algorithm, which emphasizes the factual information contained within the student’s response. These final similarity scores are employed to offer comprehensive feedback that illuminates the specific areas in which the student’s comprehension may be lacking. Finally, the proposed approach is compared to other renowned algorithms like Cosine Similarity, Word Mover’s Distance, Paraphrase-mpnet, and Multi-qa-mpnet.

Such methods primarily focus on learning the direct similarity of the samples, ignoring the latent high-order correlations across views.

The modified locust swarm algorithm avoids concentration of individuals at the current best positions, reduces the probability of premature convergence, and maintains the intensification/diversification balance. The modified spider colony algorithm models two unique behavior patterns, allows diversification of the search space for the optimal solution, and acts as a filter to reduce the influence of very good or bad solutions on the search process.

A recent differential testing of three state-of- the-art AST mapping algorithms, i.e., GumTree, MTDiff, and IJM, reveals that the algorithms generate inaccurate mappings for a considerable number of file revisions. We find that the inaccurate mappings could be caused by the mutual influence: the mappings of lower-level AST nodes (e.g., tokens) have impacts on the mappings of higher-level AST nodes (e.g., statements) and vice versa. This mutual influence issue is rarely considered by existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called iASTMapper, that iteratively map two ASTs based on the similarities between AST nodes. Given a file revision, we extract three types of AST nodes in different levels of program structures (i.e., tokens, statements, and inner-statements) from the ASTs of the two source code files. We first build mappings of the unchanged statements and inner-statements. Then, we use an iterative method to map the rest of the nodes without mapping. For each of the three types of nodes, we iteratively map the nodes based on their similarities measured using heuristic rules. We further use an iterative mechanism to connect the three iterative mapping processes by considering the mutual influence between the mappings of different types of nodes. Finally, a series of code edit actions are generated from the node mappings to help users understand and locate the code changes during revisions. We conduct experiments to compare iASTMapper with three baselines, i.e., GumTree, MTDiff, and IJM, by automatically evaluating 210,997 file revisions from ten Java projects. Furthermore, we manually evaluate the correctness of the code edit actions generated for 200 file revisions with 12 evaluators. The results demonstrate that iASTMapper outperforms the baselines. iASTMapper can generate shorter code edit actions by at least 1.29% than the baselines, with a high accuracy of 96.23%.",2643-1572,979-8-3503-2996-4,10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00178,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298413,AST mapping;Code change analysis,Java;Codes;Source coding;Software algorithms;Syntactics;Iterative algorithms;Testing,,,,36,IEEE,8 Nov 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

Frequent pattern mining techniques are extensively studied in numerous domains, including market basket data analysis, data mining, recommender system, web log mining, sequential pattern mining, and software bug detection. In frequent itemset mining, the support-based framework is frequently used to find itemsets with a frequency over a predetermined threshold. Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat, FP-Max, SaM and Relim are a few of the FPM algorithms that have been created to efficiently search for frequent itemsets in datasets. While FP-Growth utilizes a tree-based approach and does not require candidate generation, the Apriori method generates candidate itemsets using a level- wise search strategy and the Apriori property. Eclat employs an equivalence class clustering and lattice traversal technique, while FP-Max focuses on mining maximal frequent itemsets. Relim is a list-based, result-driven mining technique, while SaM is used to mine associative rules. A review and comparison of numerous frequent pattern mining algorithms, including Apriori, FP- growth, Eclat, FP-max, COFI, SaM, and ReLim, are presented in this paper.

This method involves several steps. First, we clean and organize defect-related knowledge, defining concepts of defect entities, attributes, and relationships to establish a code defect knowledge graph. Next, using abstract syntax trees, we extract various information from the code, including control flow diagrams, control dependency graphs, data dependency graphs, program dependency graphs, and code attribute graphs, to capture relevant details about nodes and edges. Based on the structural and logical information represented by node-edge associations, we employ the Deepwalk algorithm to construct a directed graph of the code and generate random walk sequences. These sequences serve as a foundation for learning and vector representation. Finally, we compare the vector similarities between the generated representations and a candidate code list from the defect knowledge graph, which has undergone initial semantic threshold filtering.

We illustrate that polarization diversity can dramatically reduce a key metric for LPD against feature detection schemes: the Degree of Cyclostationarity (DCS) of the received signal. This reduces the probability of signal detection at an adversarial receiver. Moreover, random sequence selection and time-dithering are both proven to be potent methods for reducing cyclic correlations and can combine to provide a 94.6% reduction in DCS at the receiver. To facilitate communication with asynchronous SDRs several post-correction measures are described which enable demodulation of the received data. These are tested and shown to be effective even in the absence of an explicit preamble, which is critical to maintain the LPD nature of the communication signal.",,978-1-946815-19-4,10.23919/USNC-URSINRSM60317.2024.10464567,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10464567,,Wireless communication;Measurement;Correlation;Feature detection;Receivers;Signal detection;Software radio,,,,3,,21 Mar 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

While recent studies have sought to address this issue, most approaches suffer from either the stability-plasticity dilemma or excessive computational and parameter requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Diverse Knowledge Transfer Transformer (DKT), which incorporates two knowledge transfer mechanisms that use attention mechanisms to transfer both task-specific and task-general knowledge to the current task, along with a duplex classifier to address the stability-plasticity dilemma. Additionally, we design a loss function that clusters similar categories and discriminates between old and new tasks in the feature space. The proposed method requires only a small number of extra parameters, which are negligible in comparison to the increasing number of tasks.

Existing methods have adopted pre-trained language models (PLMs) and achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, due to the Dropout strategy, the PLM-based models suffer from inconsistency between the training and testing stages, i.e., the semantic representation during training is inconsistent with the counterpart during testing. Besides, the PLM-based models prefer to correct the erroneous characters to semantically proper or commonly used ones rather than the ground truths. And they usually neglect phonological and visual similarity knowledge between characters. In this paper, we propose a consistent and contrastive learning approach with character similarity for CSC (CCCSpell). CCCSpell is composed of a BERT-based detector and a character similarity-based corrector. The detector uses bidirectional Kullback-Leibler divergence to minimize the gap between the output distributions of two sub-models sampled by Dropout, which can enhance the consistency of the semantic representations when training and inferring to improve the testing performance. Besides, the detector employs a contrastive optimization objective to increase the confidence of targets and decrease the counterpart of common characters, which can help avoid predicting common ones. After that, the corrector tries to incorporate phonological and visual similarity knowledge into detection results by calculating the levenshtein edit distance between the shape/pronunciation representations of characters, and utilizes the confusion set to help select golden characters. Experiments are conducted on SIGHAN and OCR datasets, and the results demonstrate that CCCSpell outperforms all baseline models and achieves new state-of-the-art performances.",2161-4407,978-1-6654-8867-9,10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191137,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191137,,Training;Visualization;Semantics;Optical character recognition;Neural networks;Detectors;Task analysis,,,,29,IEEE,2 Aug 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

In particular, the use of SM is motivated by its low-complexity implementation in comparison to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, achieved through the activation of a single antenna during transmission. Moreover, energy detection-based communications restrict the channel state information to the magnitude of the fading gains. This consideration makes the design applicable for low-cost low-powered devices since phase estimation and its associated circuitry are avoided. We derive an energy detection metric for a multi-antenna receiver based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion. By considering a biased pulse amplitude modulation, we develop an analytical framework for the SM symbol error rate at high signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical results show that the diversity order is proportional to half the number of receive antennas; this result stems from having partial receiver channel knowledge. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with that of the coherent ML receiver and show that the SM energy detector outperforms its coherent counterpart in certain scenarios, particularly when utilizing non-negative constellations.

In this work, we tackled the decision-making process related to diversion scenarios. Diversion is a deviation or alternative from the original flight plan, usually due to some problem caused in the aircraft, such as leakage of fuel, of engine and in aerodynamic surfaces, among other problems of the aircraft that can make it impossible to arrive at the previously defined destination airport. We propose a case-based reasoning (CBR) model for aiding the pilot to deal with diversion situations, chosen as adequate scenarios from the results of a survey conducted with pilots to identify those for which an AI-based approach might be helpful regarding decision making. A CBR system basically uses a memory of recorded cases for generating new solutions to similar problems, it thus contains a ""memory"" of cases with descriptions of specific situations that occurred in the past, solutions of these described situations, and the evaluation of their results. The reasoner solves new problems by adapting in-memory solutions to it, via some similarity criteria. Specific similarity measures for comparing cases and retrieving the ones most similar to the diversion situation at hand were defined, and a database for 26 diversion cases was built for conducting the experiments on decision making. Case retrieval experiments over 20 diversion test situations produced a success rate (that is, a diversion suggestion compatible with pilot decisions) of 85%. We intend to perform as future work an extension of the cases database by incorporating real diversion situations, dynamic attributes related to weather and traffic intensity at the diversion airport, and a more comprehensive assessment by pilots, possibly towards a learnable automatic weight adjustment for the attributes that compose the case similarity metric.",2155-7209,979-8-3503-3357-2,10.1109/DASC58513.2023.10311203,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10311203,Decision-Making;Diversion;Artificial Intelligence;Case-Based Reasoning,Surveys;Databases;Atmospheric modeling;Decision making;Airports;Aerodynamics;Cognition,,,,13,IEEE,10 Nov 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,

Doctors wearing augmented reality glasses can use the system to see more vivid scenes of surgery.

In the registration stage, we convert the preoperative 3D CT into a DRR image using digital reconstruction image technology, which we then register with the 2D X-ray during the operation. To optimize the iteration, we employ the improved Powell algorithm. The algorithm demonstrates an average angle and position error of 0.62° and 0.56mm, respectively. Through the transformation of spatial position relationship, the transformation relationship between preoperative CT and intraoperative patient position was obtained. A user-friendly, integrated software system has been developed that allows users to view the relative relationship between surgical instruments and patient position in CT in real time during surgery. An augmented reality module has also been introduced, allowing operators to see specific surgical models in specific glasses.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) aims to develop effective communication and joint policies using group learning. Some of the previous approaches required each agent to maintain a set of networks independently, resulting in no consideration of interactions. Joint communication work causes agents receiving information unrelated to their own tasks. Currently, agents with different task divisions are often grouped by action tendency, but this can lead to poor dynamic grouping. This paper presents a two-phase solution for multiple agents, addressing these issues. The first phase develops heterogeneous agent communication joint policies using a Group Communication MARL framework (GCMA). The framework employs a periodic grouping strategy, reducing exploration and communication redundancy by dynamically assigning agent group hidden features through hyper-network and graph communication. The scheme efficiently utilizes resources for adapting to multiple similar tasks. In the second phase, each agent's policy network is distilled into a generalized simple network, adapting to similar tasks with varying quantities and sizes.

To reduce the amount of communication, the devices send quantized and compressed local decisions to the server, resulting in noisy global decisions. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between the optimization performance and the communication overhead. Existing works separately optimize computation and communication. In contrast, we jointly consider computation and communication over time, by encouraging temporal similarity in the decision sequence to control the communication overhead. We propose an efficient algorithm, termed Online Distributed Optimization with Temporal Similarity (ODOTS), where the local decisions are both computation- and communication-aware. Furthermore, ODOTS uses a novel tunable virtual queue, which completely removes the commonly assumed Slater’s condition through a modified Lyapunov drift analysis. ODOTS delivers provable performance bounds on both the optimization objective and constraint violation. As an example application, we apply ODOTS to enable communication-efficient federated learning.

The results are then used to design the interfacing algorithm that couples the hardware with the software side. But this approach typically requires detailed prior knowledge, which is frequently different from practical applications where little or no information is available about the hardware under test. Lacking a benchmark model, it is therefore rather difficult to predict what accuracy can be achieved in practice with a given interface. To avoid modeling all components of the PHIL system, this paper aims to establish the interpretation of the interfacing algorithm as an isolated two-port network. Considering the inputs and outputs as vectors, it is shown how the transmission properties of PHIL interfaces can be predicted for different frequencies and steady-state inputs.

Further, less than −15dB isolation has also been attained at all three ports, resulting in no mutual coupling between the antenna elements.",,979-8-3503-2826-4,10.1109/MAPCON58678.2023.10463981,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10463981,multiple input-multiple output (MIMO);cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (CDRA);envelope correlation co-efficient (ECC);diversity gain (DG),Microwave antennas;5G mobile communication;Dipole antennas;Electromagnetic scattering;Apertures;Dielectric resonator antennas;Microstrip,,,,14,IEEE,20 Mar 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,
A Configurable All Digital Antenna Array with a Feed-Forward Efficiency Enhancement Scheme,B. Sen; F. E. Filci,"Communication, Air and Missile Defence Program, NSPA, Luxembourg; ASELSAN AS, Turkiye",2023 20th European Radar Conference (EuRAD),26 Oct 2023,2023,,,411,414,"Multi-purpose use of a single system in radar and communication has been becoming more desirable than ever before. All digital transmitters combined with software defined receivers have been attracting increasing attention, particularly for the new generation technologies like Cognitive and MIMO in radar; and 5G/6G in communication. In this paper, a new digital antenna array system with a digital network backbone is proposed and a novel all digital Class S transmitter with enhanced waveform linearity and coding efficiency scheme is introduced. The proposed system comprises of all digital Transmit/Receive Modules (TRM) which are connected over a network system and are called SMART-TR. The network-based structure enables individual command and control over the entire TRMs which brings diversity in terms of waveform design, operational frequency, and beam shaping. An efficiency enhancement algorithm, which is referred to as Time Segmented Peak to Average Reduction (TSPAR), in a modified Class S transmitter is also introduced in the SMART-TR module. The new scheme is tested out on an input waveform with a Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of 9dB and increases the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by 3 dB from 36dB to 39dB and the coding efficiency from %10 to %40.",,978-2-87487-074-3,10.23919/EuRAD58043.2023.10289211,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10289211,Re-configurability;Diversity;Digital Array;MIMO;Cognition;DSM;Coding Efficiency;Class S transmitter,Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Systems architecture;Peak to average power ratio;Radar antennas;Transmission line measurements;Encoding,,,,7,,26 Oct 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,
