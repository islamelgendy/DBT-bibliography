Recently, there has been a growing interest in similarity-based testing of SPLs, where similarity is used as a surrogate metric for the $t$t-wise coverage. In this context, one of the primary goals is to sample, by optimizing similarity metrics using search-based algorithms, a small subset of test cases (i.e., products) as dissimilar as possible, thus potentially making more $t$t-wise combinations covered. Prior work has shown, by means of empirical studies, the great potential of current similarity-based testing approaches. However, the rationale of this testing technique deserves a more rigorous exploration. To this end, we perform correlation analyses to investigate how similarity metrics are correlated with the $t$t-wise coverage. We find that similarity metrics generally have significantly positive correlations with the $t$t-wise coverage. This well explains why similarity-based testing works, as the improvement on similarity metrics will potentially increase the $t$t-wise coverage. Moreover, we explore, for the first time, the use of the novelty search (NS) algorithm for similarity-based SPL testing. The algorithm rewards “novel” individuals, i.e., those being different from individuals discovered previously, and this well matches the goal of similarity-based SPL testing. We find that the novelty score used in NS has (much) stronger positive correlations with the $t$t-wise coverage than previous approaches relying on a genetic algorithm (GA) with a similarity-based fitness function. Experimental results on 31 software product lines validate the superiority of NS over GA, as well as other state-of-the-art approaches, concerning both $t$t-wise coverage and fault detection capacity. Finally, we investigate whether it is useful to combine two satisfiability solvers when generating new individuals in NS, and how the performance of NS is affected by its key parameters. In summary, looking for novelty provides a promising way of sampling diverse test cases for SPLs.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3057853","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906069,61773410,61876207); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011411,2019A1515011700); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202002030355,201802010007); Project Funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M662912); Guangdong Province Key Area R&D Program(grant numbers:2018B010109003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019MS088,2020ZYGXZR014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350184","Software product line testing;product sampling;novelty search;similarity-based testing;  $t$   t     -wise coverage;correlation analysis","Testing;Frequency modulation;Measurement;Software;Correlation;Software product lines;Fault detection","fault diagnosis;genetic algorithms;program testing","search-based software product line testing;testing software product lines;SPLs;possible products;wise coverage;similarity metrics;search-based algorithms;wise combinations;current similarity-based testing approaches;testing technique;novelty search algorithm;similarity-based SPL testing;similarity-based fitness function;31 software product lines;diverse test cases","","4","","90","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, test cases (which consist of one or more test steps that need to be executed manually by the tester) are often specified in natural language by different employees and many redundant test cases might exist in the test suite. This increases the (already high) cost of test execution. Manually identifying similar test cases is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to identify similar test cases. Our approach uses a combination of text embedding, text similarity and clustering techniques to identify similar test cases. We evaluate five different text embedding techniques, two text similarity metrics, and two clustering techniques to cluster similar test steps and three techniques to identify similar test cases from the test step clusters. Through an evaluation in an industrial setting, we showed that our approach achieves a high performance to cluster test steps (an F-score of 87.39%) and identify similar test cases (an F-score of 86.13%).

However, these warnings could be erroneous due to the defects of compiler warning diagnostics. Although the existing technique (i.e., Epiphron) can automatically generate test programs for compiler warning defect detection, the effectiveness of Epiphron on defect-finding is still limited, due to the limitation for generating warning-sensitive test program structures. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a DIversity-guided PROgram Mutation approach, called DIPROM, to construct diverse warning-sensitive programs for effective compiler warning defect detection. Given a seed test program, DIPROM first removes its dead code to reduce false positive warning defects. Then, the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the test program is constructed; DIPROM iteratively mutates the structures of the AST to generate warning-sensitive program variants. To effectively construct diverse warning-sensitive structures, DIPROM applies a novel diversity-guided strategy to generate program variants in each iteration. With the generated program variants, differential testing is conducted to detect warning defects in different compilers. In the experiments, we evaluate DIPROM with two popular C compilers (i.e., GCC and Clang). Experimental results show that DIPROM significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art approaches (i.e., HiCOND, Epiphron, and Hermes) by up to 18.93%$\sim$∼76.74% in terms of the bug-finding capability on average. Meanwhile, DIPROM is efficient, which spends less time on finding the same average number of warning defects. We at last applied DIPROM to the latest development versions of GCC and Clang. After two months’ running, we reported 8 new warning defects; 5 of them have been confirmed/fixed by developers.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3119186","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032004,61772107,62072068); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9566830","Compiler testing;differential testing;program mutation;test program generation","Program processors;Codes;Testing;Software;Programming;Feature extraction;Tools","C language;program compilers;program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing","AST;bug-finding capability;C compilers;Clang;compiler diagnostic warnings;compiler warning defect detection;defect-finding;DIPROM;diversity-guided program mutation;false positive warning defects;GCC;program compilation;programming mistakes;seed test program;syntax tree;warning-sensitive program variants;warning-sensitive test program structures","","2","","53","IEEE","11 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, we develop the first combination, named Fastazi, of file-based TCS and similarity-based TCP and evaluate its benefit and cost against each individual technique. We performed our experiments using 12 Java-based open-source projects. Our results show that, in the median case, the combined approach detects the first failure nearly two times faster than either Ekstazi alone (with random test ordering) or FAST alone (without TCS). Statistical analysis shows that the effectiveness of Fastazi is higher than that of Ekstazi, which in turn is higher than that of FAST. On the other hand, FAST adds the least overhead to testing time, while the difference between the additional time needed by Ekstazi and Fastazi is negligible. Fastazi can also improve failure detection in scenarios where the time available for testing is restricted.

In this paper, we report a current practice in a company that maintains an industrial simulator as a critical component of their business. The simulator automatically records all the users’ requests and the simulation results in storage. The feature provides a huge number of test cases for regression testing to developers; however, their time budget for testing is limited (i.e., at most one night). Hence, the developers need to select a small number of test cases to confirm both the simulation result and execution performance are unaffected by an update of a dependent component. In other words, the test cases should achieve high coverage while keeping diversity of execution time. To solve the problem, we have developed a clustering-based method to select test cases, using the similarity of execution traces produced by them. The developers have used the method for a half year; they recognize that the method is better than the previous rule-based method used in the company.","2576-3148","978-1-6654-7956-1","10.1109/ICSME55016.2022.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978230","Test Selection;Dynamic Analysis;Software De-pendency;Clustering","Measurement;Software maintenance;Runtime;Costs;Simulation;Computer bugs;Companies","pattern clustering;program debugging;program testing;regression analysis;security of data","execution performance;industrial simulator;regression testing","","","","9","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate how to drive the test set generation process with semantic information in the form of output diversity. We present the first totally automatic output sampling for output diversity unit test set generation tool, called OutGen. OutGen transforms a program into an SMT formula in bit-vector arithmetic. It then applies universal hashing in order to generate an output-based diverse set of inputs. The result offers significant diversity improvements when measured as a high output uniqueness count. It achieves this by ensuring that the test set’s output probability distribution is uniform, i.e., highly diverse. The use of output sampling, as opposed to any of input sampling, CBMC, CAVM, behaviour diversity or random testing improves mutation score and bug detection by up to 4150 and 963 percent respectively on programs drawn from three different corpora: the R-project, SIR and CodeFlaws. OutGen test sets achieve an average mutation score of up to 92 percent, and 70 percent of the test sets detect the defect.

Therefore, some researchers attempt to resolve the problem of test report prioritization and have proposed many methods. However, these methods do not consider the impact of duplicate test reports. In this paper, we focus on the problem of test report prioritization and present a new method named DivClass by combining a diversity strategy and a classification strategy. First, we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess crowdsourced test reports. Then, we build a similarity matrix by introducing an asymmetric similarity computation strategy.

A cross-comparison involving the formed clusters and a comparison with randomly formed clusters points to configurations that tend to reach high effectiveness in foreseeing the best mutation operators for untested programs.","2159-4848","978-1-6654-9628-5","10.1109/ICSTW55395.2022.00041","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787949","mutation testing;cost reduction;program similarity","Software testing;Measurement;Java;Costs;Codes;Conferences;Plagiarism","cost reduction;Java;program testing;source code (software)","SiMut configurations;Java programs;program similarity;program abstraction;source code;internal complexity metrics;mutation cost reduction;mutation testing;similarity calculation","","","","31","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our study presents a multi-region geographical analysis of gender inclusion on GitHub. This mixed-methods approach includes quantitatively investigating differences in gender inclusion in projects across geographic regions and investigate these trends over time using data from contributions to 21,456 project repositories. We also qualitatively understand the unique experiences of developers contributing to these projects through a survey that is strategically targeted to developers in various regions worldwide. Our findings indicate that gender diversity is low across all parts of the world, with no substantial difference across regions. However, there has been statistically significant improvement in diversity worldwide since 2014, with certain regions such as Africa improving at faster pace. We also find that most motivations and barriers to contributions (e.g., lack of resources to contribute and poor working environment) were shared across regions, however, some insightful differences, such as how to make projects more inclusive, did arise. From these findings, we derive and present implications for tools that can foster inclusion in open source software communities and empower contributions from everyone, everywhere.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3092813","Research Lab for Intelligent Software Engineering; School of Computing and Information Systems; Singapore Management University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9466393","Inclusion;OSS;software engineering;empirical studies;GitHub;diversity;gender;geographic regions","Gender issues;Software development management;Open source software;Software engineering;Europe;Toy manufacturing industry;Industries","DP industry;gender issues;public domain software","OSS;multiregion geographical analysis;gender inclusion;mixed-methods approach;geographic regions;gender diversity;statistically significant improvement;open source software communities;geographic gender-inclusion;gender gap;software industry;gender differences;GitHub","","7","","81","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, DNNs can exhibit erroneous behaviours that may lead to critical errors, especially when used in safety-critical systems. Inspired by testing techniques for traditional software systems, researchers have proposed neuron coverage criteria, as an analogy to source code coverage, to guide the testing of DNNs. Despite very active research on DNN coverage, several recent studies have questioned the usefulness of such criteria in guiding DNN testing. Further, from a practical standpoint, these criteria are white-box as they require access to the internals or training data of DNNs, which is often not feasible or convenient. Measuring such coverage requires executing DNNs with candidate inputs to guide testing, which is not an option in many practical contexts. In this paper, we investigate diversity metrics as an alternative to white-box coverage criteria. For the previously mentioned reasons, we require such metrics to be black-box and not rely on the execution and outputs of DNNs under test. To this end, we first select and adapt three diversity metrics and study, in a controlled manner, their capacity to measure actual diversity in input sets. We then analyze their statistical association with fault detection using four datasets and five DNNs. We further compare diversity with state-of-the-art white-box coverage criteria. As a mechanism to enable such analysis, we also propose a novel way to estimate fault detection in DNNs. Our experiments show that relying on the diversity of image features embedded in test input sets is a more reliable indicator than coverage criteria to effectively guide DNN testing. Indeed, we found that one of our selected black-box diversity metrics far outperforms existing coverage criteria in terms of fault-revealing capability and computational time. Results also confirm the suspicions that state-of-the-art coverage criteria are not adequate to guide the construction of test input sets to detect as many faults as possible using natural inputs.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3243522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041782","Coverage;deep neural network;diversity;faults;test","Measurement;Testing;Feature extraction;Closed box;Fault detection;Neurons;Computational modeling","","","","","","","CCBY","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

At the beginning of the test, K-Means clustering is performed on the test case suite and the test cases filtered can cover more execution information. Next, for the test cases with failed execution results, the test cases with similar execution information are filtered to better highlight the fault information in the failed test cases.

The goal of the paper is to determine the testability of a circuit (circuit2) given a test set for a structurally similar circuit (circuit1). This is achieved by transforming a test set generated for circuit1 into a test set for circuit2 as efficiently as possible, without repeating the entire test generation process. The process described in the paper starts with a structural analysis of circuit1 and circuit2 to obtain a mapping between their inputs and outputs.

An analysis of which challenges in software engineering teams are most frequent is still missing. As teams are more international, it is more frequent that their members have different human values as well as different communication habits. Additionally, virtual team setups (working geographically separated, remote communication using digital tools and frequently changing team members) are increasingly prevalent. Objective: We aim to provide a starting point for a theory about contemporary human challenges in teams and their causes in software engineering. To do so, we look to establish a reusable set of challenges and start out by investigating the effect of team virtualization. Virtual teams often use digital communication and consist of members with different nationalities that may have more divergent human values due to cultural differences compared to single nationality teams. Method: We designed a survey instrument and asked respondents to assess the frequency and criticality of a set of challenges, separated in context ”within teams” as well as ”between teams and clients”, compiled from previous empirical work, blog posts, and pilot survey feedback. For the team challenges, we asked if mitigation measures were already in place to tackle the challenge. Respondents were also asked to provide information about their team setup. The survey included the Personal Value Questionnaire to measure Schwartz human values. Finally, respondents were asked if there were additional challenges at their workplace. The survey was first piloted and then distributed to professionals working in software engineering teams via social networking sites and personal business networks. Result: In this article, we report on the results obtained from 192 respondents. We present a set of challenges that takes the survey feedback into account and introduce two categories of challenges; ”interpersonal” and ”intrapersonal”. We found no evidence for links between human values and challenges. We found some significant links between the number of distinct nationalities in a team and certain challenges, with less frequent and critical challenges occurring if 2-3 different nationalities were present compared to a team having members of just one nationality or more than three. A higher degree of virtualization seems to increase the frequency of some human challenges, which warrants further research about how to improve working processes when teams work from remote or in a distributed fashion. Conclusion: We present a set of human challenges in software engineering that can be used for further research on causes and mitigation measures, which serves as our starting point for a theory about causes of contemporary human challenges in software engineering teams. We report on evidence that a higher degree of virtualization of teams leads to an increase of certain challenges. This warrants further research to gather more evidence and test countermeasures, such as whether the employment of virtual reality software incorporating facial expressions and movements can help establish a less detached way of communication.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3148539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706331","Software engineering;human challenges;virtual teams;human values;diversity;survey research","Software engineering;Software;Virtualization;Virtual groups;Cultural differences;Human factors;Productivity","behavioural sciences;cultural aspects;groupware;human computer interaction;human factors;organisational aspects;social networking (online);software engineering;software prototyping;team working;virtual reality;Web sites","2-3 different nationalities;contemporary challenges;contemporary human challenges;different human values;divergent human values;frequent challenges;nationality teams;Schwartz human values;software engineering teams;team challenges;team members;team setup;team virtualization;virtual team setups;virtual teams","","","","56","IEEE","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even though a number of sampling strategies have been proposed, they either fail to produce diverse samples with respect to the number of selected features (an important property to characterize behaviors of configurations), or achieve diverse sampling but with limited scalability (the handleable configuration space size is limited to 1013). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a scalable diverse sampling strategy, which uses a distance metric in combination with the novelty search algorithm to produce diverse samples in an incremental way. The distance metric is carefully designed to measure similarities between configurations, and further diversity of a sample set. The novelty search incrementally improves diversity of samples through the search for novel configurations. We evaluate our sampling algorithm on 39 real-world SPLs. It is able to generate the required number of samples for all the SPLs, including those which cannot be counted by sharpSAT, a state-of-the-art model counting solver. Moreover, it performs better than or at least competitively to state-of-the-art samplers regarding diversity of the sample set.

This is a challenging task since the test sets can grow over time as the new data is being acquired, and it becomes time-consuming. Input prioritization is necessary to reduce the testing time since prioritized test inputs are more likely to reveal the erroneous behavior of a DL system earlier during test execution. Input prioritization approaches have been rudimentary analyzed against each other, this study compares different input prioritization techniques regarding their effectiveness and efficiency. This work considers surprise adequacy, autoencoder-based, and similarity-based input prioritization approaches in the example of testing a DL image classification algorithms applied on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and STL-10 datasets. To measure effectiveness and efficiency, we use a modified APFD (Average Percentage of Fault Detected), and set up & execution time, respectively. We observe that the surprise adequacy is the most effective (0.785 to 0.914 APFD). The autoencoder-based and similarity-based techniques are less effective, with the performance from 0.532 to 0.744 APFD and 0.579 to 0.709 APFD, respectively. In contrast, the similarity-based and surprise adequacy-based approaches are the most and least efficient, respectively. The findings in this work demonstrate the trade-off between the considered input prioritization techniques to understanding their practical applicability for testing DL algorithms.","","978-1-6654-6152-8","10.1109/SEAA56994.2022.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10011200","test prioritization;deep learning;diversity-based testing","Deep learning;Fault detection;Software algorithms;Software systems;Time measurement;Classification algorithms;Task analysis","deep learning (artificial intelligence);image classification;program testing","APFD;autoencoder-based techniques;average percentage of fault detected;CIFAR-10;deep learning algorithms;DL algorithms;DL image classification algorithms;Fashion-MNIST;MNIST;similarity-based input prioritization;software systems;STL-10 datasets;surprise adequacy-based approaches","","","","31","IEEE","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Without a process to move from finding to fixing, acting upon such findings is an ad-hoc activity, at the mercy of the skills of each individual developer. To address this gap, we created Why/Where/Fix, a systematic inclusivity debugging process whose inclusivity fault localization harnesses Information Architecture(IA)-the way user-facing information is organized, structured and labeled. We then conducted a multi-stage qualitative empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of Why/Where/Fix, using an Open Source Software (OSS) project's infrastructure as our setting. In our study, the OSS project team used the Why/Where/Fix process to find inclusivity bugs, localize the IA faults behind them, and then fix the IA to remove the inclusivity bugs they had found. Our results showed that using Why/Where/Fix reduced the number of inclusivity bugs that OSS newcomer participants experienced by 90%. Diverse teams have been shown to be more productive as well as more innovative. One form of diversity, cognitive diversity - differences in cognitive styles - helps generate diversity of thoughts. However, cognitive diversity is often not supported in software tools. This means that these tools are not inclusive of individuals with different cognitive styles (e.g., those who like to learn through process vs. those who learn by tinkering), which burdens these individuals with a cognitive “tax” each time they use the tool. In this work, we present an approach that enables software developers to: (1) evaluate their tools, especially those that are information-heavy, to find “inclusivity bugs”- cases where diverse cognitive styles are unsupported, (2) find where in the tool these bugs lurk, and (3) fix these bugs. Our evaluation in an open source project shows that by following this approach developers were able to reduce inclusivity bugs in their projects by 90%.","","978-1-6654-9594-3","10.1145/3510458.3513009","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1901031,2042324,2008089); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794009","Diversity;Information Architecture;Open Source;Inclusivity Bugs","Location awareness;Systematics;Computer bugs;Sociology;Debugging;Statistics;Software tools","cognition;computer aided instruction;groupware;program debugging;program testing;public domain software;software development management;software engineering;software quality","systematic inclusivity debugging process;inclusivity fault;Open Source Software project;debug inclusivity bugs","","","","67","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detecting bugs in large systems may significantly increase maintenance costs. Despite the fact that several techniques for clone identification have been proposed over the years, the accuracy and scalability of clone detection techniques remain hot research areas. Previously, Akram et al. proposed the DroidCC hybrid technique, where tokens were encoded into MD5 hash values by encoding them into 128-bit fingerprints, and clones were identified by matching identical hash values. Encoding tokens into MD5 hash values take more time due to the large fingerprint size of MD5 hash values. Due to the enormous chunk size, DroidCC cannot achieve higher accuracy. To overcome the weakness of the DroidCC technique, We proposed a novel AYAT a lightweight hybrid technique to detect clones at the fragment level. To speed up the detection process, we converted tokens into 32-bit polynomial values, and we set the chunk size to 5 lines per chunk to improve accuracy. We tested our technique on 10,968 java projects against 4.98 million lines of code. In comparison to the well-known DroidCC technique, it is significantly faster and more efficient. Our examination demonstrates that precision is significantly improved despite sacrificing scalability.

Each breakage that newly occurs from daily runs needs to be manually inspected, triaged, and eventually assigned to developers for debugging. However, not all new breakages are unique, as some test breakages would share the same root cause; in addition, human errors can produce duplicate bug tickets for the same root cause. An automated identification of breakages with shared root causes will be able to significantly reduce the cost of the (typically manual) post-breakage steps. This paper investigates multiple similarity functions between test breakages to assist and automate the identification of test breakages that are caused by the same root cause. We consider multiple information sources, such as static (i.e., the code itself), historical (i.e., whether the test results have changed in a similar way in the past), as well as dynamic (i.e., whether the coverage of test cases are similar to each other), for the purpose of such automation. We evaluate a total of 27 individual similarity functions, using realworld CI data of SAP HANA from a six-month period. Further, using these individual similarity functions as in-put features, we construct a classification model that can predict whether two test breakages share the same root cause or not. When trained using ground truth labels extracted from the issue tracker of SAP HANA, our model achieves an F1 score of 0.743 when evaluated using a set of unseen test breakages collected over three months. Our results show that a classification model based on test similarity functions can successfully support the bug triage stage of a CI pipeline.","","978-1-6654-9590-5","10.1145/3510457.3513051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793878","Continuous Integration;Test Similarity;Root Cause Analysis","Root cause analysis;Pipelines;Computer bugs;Debugging;Manuals;Predictive models;Feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification;pipelines;program debugging;public domain software","unseen test breakages;test similarity functions;identifying shared root causes;SAP HANA;post-breakage steps;27 individual similarity functions","","","","44","IEEE","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, developers heavily rely on obfuscation to harden their products and reduce the risk of adversarial reverse engineering. However, despite its spectacular progress, one crucial hurdle is that each of existing obfuscation method is designed specifically for obfuscating one program feature (e.g., identifier name, control flow), so an effective obfuscation scheme usually composes a considerable amount of different obfuscation methods. Therefore, one primary challenge lies in identifying effective combinations of obfuscation methods. In this research, we propose a principled technique for generating an optimal program obfuscation scheme by adopting a reinforcement learning approach. Given a program and a set of obfuscation transformations, a reinforcement learning model is progressively trained to select a sequence of obfuscation transformations, such that applying each transformation in order toward the program yields the optimal obfuscation result, making programs dissimilar while retaining reasonable instrumentation overhead. Our implementation can directly work on raw binary executables without source code, and our evaluation demonstrates that the trained models can effectively obfuscate executable files with low cost.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.3041655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9275317","Software obfuscation;reinforcement learning;reverse engineering;software similarity","Software;Transforms;Reinforcement learning;Reverse engineering;Control systems;Tools;Switches","invasive software;Java;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program testing;reverse engineering;security of data;software engineering","reinforcement learning approach;obfuscation transformations;reinforcement learning model;optimal obfuscation result;generating effective software obfuscation sequences;prevalent security technique;program semantics;adversarial reverse engineering;existing obfuscation method;obfuscating;effective obfuscation scheme;different obfuscation methods;effective combinations;optimal program obfuscation scheme","","","","92","IEEE","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the surging research interest in BCSA, it is significantly challenging to perform new research in this field for several reasons. First, most existing approaches focus only on the end results, namely, increasing the success rate of BCSA by adopting uninterpretable machine learning. Moreover, they utilize their own benchmark sharing neither the source code nor the entire dataset. Finally, researchers often use different terminologies or even use the same technique without citing the previous literature properly, which makes it difficult to reproduce or extend previous work. To address these problems, we take a step back from the mainstream and contemplate fundamental research questions for BCSA. Why does a certain technique or a feature show better results than the others? Specifically, we conduct the first systematic study on the basic features used in BCSA by leveraging interpretable feature engineering on a large-scale benchmark. Our study reveals various useful insights on BCSA. For example, we show that a simple interpretable model with a few basic features can achieve a comparable result to that of recent deep learning-based approaches. Furthermore, we show that the way we compile binaries or the correctness of underlying binary analysis tools can significantly affect the performance of BCSA. Lastly, we make all our source code and benchmark public and suggest future directions in this field to help further research.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3187689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9813408","Binary code similarity analysis;similarity measures;feature evaluation and selection;benchmark","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Binary codes;Syntactics;Semantics;Licenses;Market research","","","","1","","","CCBY","1 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

G3P has been shown capable of successfully evolving programs in arbitrary languages that solve several program synthesis problems based only on a set of input/output examples. Despite its success, the restriction on the evolutionary system to only leverage input/output error rate during its assessment of the programs it derives limits its scalabil-ity to larger and more complex program synthesis problems. With the growing number and size of open software repositories and generative artificial intelligence approaches, there is a sizeable and growing number of approaches for retrieving/generating source code (potentially several partial snippets) based on textual problem descriptions. Therefore, it is now, more than ever, time to introduce G3P to other means of user intent (particularly textual problem descriptions). In this paper, we would like to assess the potential for G3P to evolve programs based on their similarity to particular target codes of interest (obtained using some code retrieval/generative approach). Through our experimental evaluation on a well-known program synthesis benchmark, we have shown that G3P successfully manages to evolve some of the desired programs with all four considered similarity measures. However, in its default configuration, G3P is not as successful with similarity measures as it is with the classical input/output error rate when solving program synthesis problems. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-objective G3P approach that combines the similarity to the target program and the traditional input/output error rate. Our experiments show that compared to the error-based G3P, the multi-objective G3P approach could improve the success rate of specific problems and has great potential to improve on the traditional G3P system.","","978-1-6654-6708-7","10.1109/CEC55065.2022.9870312","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:13/RC/2094_P2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870312","Program Synthesis;Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming;Code Similarity;Multi-Objective Optimization","Codes;Error analysis;Measurement uncertainty;Genetic programming;Evolutionary computation;Benchmark testing;Software","artificial intelligence;context-free grammars;data mining;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;grammars","code given user intent;larger program synthesis problems;more complex program synthesis problems;generative artificial intelligence approaches;source code;particularly textual problem descriptions;particular target codes;well-known program synthesis benchmark;desired programs;considered similarity measures;solving program synthesis problems;novel multiobjective G3P approach;target program;error-based G3P;traditional G3P system;multiobjective grammar-guided Genetic Programming;code similarity measurement;successful approaches","","1","","33","IEEE","6 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, several approaches for automatic assessment of the APR-generated patches are proposed. Among them, dynamic patch correctness assessment relies on comparing run-time information obtained from the program before and after patching. Object similarity-based dynamic patch ranking approaches, specifically, capture system state snapshots after the impact point of patches and express behavior differences in term of object graphs similarities. Dynamic approaches rely on the assumption that, when running the originally passing test cases, the correct patches will not alter the program behavior in a significant way, but such patches will significantly change program behavior for the failing test cases. This paper presents the results of an extensive empirical study on two object similarity-based approaches, i.e., ObjSim and CIP, to rank 1,290 APR-generated patches, used in previous APR research. We found that although ObjSim outperforms CIP, in terms of the number of patches ranked in top-1 position, it still does not offer an improvement over random baseline ranking, representing the setting with no automatic patch correctness assessment in place. This observation warrants further research on the validity of the assumptions underlying these two techniques and the techniques based on similar assumptions.","","978-1-4503-9285-3","10.1145/3524459.3527354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9809091","Automated Program Repair;Patch Ranking;Object Similarity","Conferences;Computer bugs;Maintenance engineering;Behavioral sciences","graph theory;program debugging;program testing;software maintenance","object similarity-based patch ranking;generate-and-validate automated program repair systems;plausible patches;test suite;dynamic patch correctness assessment;patching;object similarity-based dynamic patch ranking approaches;capture system state snapshots;object graphs similarities;dynamic approaches;originally passing test cases;correct patches;program behavior;extensive empirical study;1 APR-generated patches;290 APR-generated patches;previous APR research;automatic patch correctness assessment;similar assumptions","","","","44","","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, most of the methods to solve the problem of multi-label emotion recognition focus on analyzing the semantics of the text, ignoring the semantic information brought by emotion tags, and not modeling the semantic relationship between emotion labels and text. In this paper, a method of multi-label emotion recognition based on label similarity attention mechanism is proposed. In this method, bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used to obtain the context knowledge of the text, so as to achieve the purpose of learning the global information of the text. The label features are learned by the label encoder. The label similarity attention mechanism is used to obtain the correlation matrix between the label and the word representation, and further strengthen the semantic information. At the same time, CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) is used to obtain local semantic information. The semantic representation of sentences is enriched. Finally, emotion recognition is carried out through the classifier. In the classifier, this paper proposes a joint loss function, which enables the model to learn the emotional characteristics of texts and labels at the same time. The model combines the global and local information of the text to show the semantic relationship between the text and the emotional label. The experimental results on the NLPCC2014Task1 dataset show that the proposed model has a certain performance improvement compared with the benchmark method.","","978-1-6654-7997-4","10.1109/IWECAI55315.2022.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750847","Multi-label classification;Sentiment classification;Attention mechanism","Emotion recognition;Analytical models;Correlation;Codes;Semantics;Blogs;Benchmark testing","convolutional neural nets;emotion recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;word processing","attention mechanism;emotional state;multilabel emotion recognition focus;semantic information;label features;label encoder;emotional label;bidirectional LSTM;context knowledge;global information;correlation matrix;word representation;CNN","","","","12","IEEE","11 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous research has explored design diversity, data diversity, and duplication techniques to detect such faults in other safety-critical domains. However, these are challenging to use for AVs in practice due to significant resource overhead and design complexity. We propose, DiverseAV, a low-cost data-diversity-based redundancy technique for detecting safety-critical random hardware faults in computational elements. DiverseAV introduces data-diversity between the redundant agents by exploiting the temporal semantic consistency available in the AV sensor data. DiverseAV is a black-box technique that offers a plug-and-play solution as it requires no knowledge of the internals of the AI agent responsible for executing driving decisions, requiring little to no modification to the agent itself for achieving high coverage of transient and permanent hardware faults. It is commercially viable because it avoids software modifications to agents that are costly in terms of development and testing time. Specifically, DiverseAV distributes the sensor data between the two software agents in a round-robin manner. As a result, the sensor data for two consecutive time steps are semantically similar in terms of their worldview but significantly different at the bit level, thus ensuring the state and data diversity between the two agents necessary for detecting faults. We demonstrate DiverseAV using an open-source self-driving AI agent which is controlling a car in an open-source world simulator.","2158-3927","978-1-6654-1693-1","10.1109/DSN53405.2022.00021","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833576","","Redundancy;Vehicle safety;Semantics;Hardware;Software agents;Complexity theory;Artificial intelligence","automobiles;control engineering computing;fault diagnosis;mobile robots;road safety;safety-critical software;software agents;software fault tolerance;traffic engineering computing","autonomous vehicle computational elements;vehicle safety;safety-critical domains;DiverseAV;low-cost data-diversity-based redundancy technique;redundant agents;temporal semantic consistency;AV sensor data;black-box technique;temporal data diversity;AV compute systems;silent data corruption;safety-critical fault detection;safety-critical random hardware fault detection;plug-and-play solution;software agents;open-source self-driving AI agent;car;open-source world simulator","","2","","70","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, we argue that focusing solely on covering many different branches (i.e., the richness) is not sufficient since the majority of the covered branches may have been exercised only once, which does not inspire a high confidence in the reliability of the covered code. Instead, the distribution of the executed branches (i.e., the evenness) should also be considered. That is, behavioral diversity is only given if the generated inputs not only trigger many different branches, but also trigger them evenly often with diverse inputs. We introduce BEDIVFUZZ, a feedback-driven fuzzing technique for generator-based fuzzers. BEDIVFUZZ distinguishes between structure-preserving and structure-changing mutations in the space of syntactically valid inputs, and biases its mutation strategy towards validity and behavioral diversity based on the received program feedback. We have evaluated BEDIVFUZZ on Ant, Maven, Rhino, Closure, Nashorn, and Tomcat.

It has been beneficial for research on clone detection and evaluating the performance of clone detection tools, for which it has become standard. It has also been used in machine learning approaches to clone detection or code similarity detection. However, the way BigCloneBench has been constructed makes it problematic to use as ground truth for learning code similarity. This paper highlights the features of BigCloneBench that affect the ground truth quality and discusses common misperceptions about the benchmark. For example, extending or replacing the ground truth without understanding the properties of BigCloneBench often leads to wrong assumptions which can lead to invalid results. Also, a manual investigation of a sample of Weak-Type-3/Type-4 clone pairs revealed 86% of pairs to be false positives, threatening the results of machine learning approaches using BigCloneBench.

By running the test on input from field remote terminal units streamed from the same input source as that presented to the main control system, our algorithm is able to examine the degree of similarity of logged outputs, and highlight possible departures from expected behaviour.

When two adjacent objective vectors are similar but the difference in the corresponding decision vectors is large, it is difficult to transfer from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. In this article, we argue that the key to overcoming this difficulty is the evaluation assignment for different subproblems based on local density and global utility. We propose a local-density measurement model to estimate the solution density around each subproblem. Based on the model, a local-diversity evaluation assignment strategy for the decomposition-based MOEA is designed to assign fitness evaluations among different subproblems. Two discrete MOPs are selected as test instances for experiments because they satisfy the premise that the difference in the corresponding decision vectors of adjacent objective vectors is large. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy enhances the population diversity. Besides, the combination of the proposed strategy and the evaluation assignment for high global utility subproblems can overcome the difficulty in transferring from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. The results also verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art evaluation assignment MOEAs regarding the inverted generational distance and the hypervolume metrics.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2022.3207457","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876207,62276103,61971052,61906069); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2214050004299); Guangdong Province Key Area Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018B010109003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020ZYGXZR014); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFC2004300,2020YFC2004302); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011700); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202002030355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906131","Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs);discrete multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs);local-density measurement;local-diversity evaluation assignment (LdEA)","Resource management;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Dynamic scheduling;Transforms;Stochastic processes","evolutionary computation;optimisation;vectors","adjacent objective vectors;decision vectors;decomposition-based MOEA;decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;fitness evaluations;global utility subproblems;hypervolume metrics;inverted generational distance;local-density measurement model;local-diversity evaluation assignment;MOP;multiobjective optimization problem;population diversity;solution density","","","","49","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, similarity relationships in a triplet are uncertain except providing a condition. For example, the previous comparison becomes invalid once the conditional label changes to “is vehicle”. To this end, we introduce a novel evaluation criterion by predicting the comparison's correctness after assigning the learned embeddings to their optimal conditions, which measures how much WS-CSL could cover latent semantics as the supervised model. Furthermore, we propose the Distance Induced Semantic COndition VER-ification Network (DiscoverNet), which characterizes the instance-instance and triplets-condition relations in a “decompose-and-fuse” manner. To make the learned embeddings cover all semantics, Discovernet utilizes a set module or an additional regularizer over the correspondence between a triplet and a condition.

Based on previous improvements to the LPA, this article proposes a new LPA (NOHLPA) that joins multilayer neighborhood overlap and historical label similarity. The NOHLPA considers both the node update order and label selection rules. We cited the label entropy as the basis for node update order and defined multilayer neighborhood overlap and historical label similarity for calculating node preferences to devise more appropriate label selection rules.

Saturation attacks against the SDN switches and controllers are major security concerns in SD-IoT. When using the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory (DSE) to detect various saturation attacks, the simple mutual information calculation may cause information loss problem, leading to the decrease of detection accuracy. Therefore, how to avoid information loss problem to improve the detection performance is a key issue. Aiming to solve the above-mentioned issues, we propose KIND, a novel image mutual information-based decision fusion method for saturation attack detection in SD-IoT. The main idea of KIND is that it converts the probability matrix of binary classifiers to images and detects the saturation attacks by fusing these images. More specifically, when executing the evidence fusion, each evidence is converted to an image by a nonlinear transformation method. Each image is converted from the related probability-supported matrix. Then, the evidence can be fixed by comparing structural similarities among different images. After that, all evidence can be utilized to obtain the final detection results using the conducted combination rule. The evaluation results demonstrate that KIND can achieve high detection performance, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of TPR, TNR, FPR, FNR, accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, confusion matrix, ROC curves, PR curves, Chi-square test, correlation coefficient, and the quantitative strategy test.

This paper presents a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (DCG-EA/I) driven by deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). First, the evolutionary individuals are encoded to fit the training of GANs. Then, an escaping strategy driven by DCGAN is proposed to expand evolutionary individuals space and enhance evolutionary population diversity. Moreover, we use a iterative local search 2-opt method to improve the quality of the solutions. Finally, a negative-as-positive mechanism is constructed so as to stabilize the training process of DCGAN and reduce the harm caused by mode collapse. The algorithm is tested on TSP standard library instances and real-world instances. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can mitigate the problem of local convergence and achieve competitive performances over other GAN-based algorithms.","2831-7475","978-1-6654-9062-7","10.1109/ICPR56361.2022.9956322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9956322","generative adversarial networks;combinatorial optimization;evolutionary algorithm;local search","Training;Sociology;Evolutionary computation;Generative adversarial networks;Search problems;Hybrid power systems;Statistics","combinatorial mathematics;evolutionary computation;iterative methods;neural nets;search problems","DCG-EA;DCGAN;deep convolutional generative adversarial networks;diverse samples;efficient deep neural networks;evolutionary individuals space;evolutionary population diversity;GAN-based algorithms;hybrid evolutionary algorithm;integrating iterative local search;iterative local search 2-opt method;population diversity enhancement;powerful fitting ability","","","","31","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is based on treating the initialization problem as a supervised learning one; taking examples from similar machines and similar tasks for which good control parameters have been found, and using those examples to build models that predict good control parameters for new machines and tasks yet to be initialized. Two of such models are proposed, one based on random forest regressors and a second based on neural networks. The random forest is highly data-efficient but generalizes only moderately. The neural network is able to leverage a high-dimensional burner run input to perform automatic system identification and generalization. While the proposed approach can be applied to a variety of applications for which example data from well functioning controllers can be used to hot-start new ones, we applied it in this paper to three slider-crank setups performing a variety of similar tasks. We found that both models outperform a benchmark of using a physics-inspired model for the initialization.

However, we observe that the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are no longer sustained in aggregate flows since the bandwidth decided by TCP is usually different from the desired rate of each service. Therefore, this article explores an idea to control the rates of only a few service flows so that the rates of all uncontrolled flows allocated by TCP will meet their QoS requirements. We design a new architecture, called Scalable Per-Flow Rate Allocation (SPFRA), and formulate a new optimization problem, termed Scalable Rate Allocation for Aggregate Flows (SRAF), to find a minimum number of controlled flows to increase the scalability of SDN with diverse service requirements. We prove the NP-hardness and inapproximability of SRAF. To solve the problem, we design an algorithm, named Aggregate Flow Selection and Flow Release (AFSFR), to achieve the tightest bound and extend it to support distributed computation and dynamic traffic for instant services. Simulations and implementation on an SDN testbed manifest that AFSFR performs nearly optimally in real networks, and the number of controlled flows can be effectively reduced by 50 percent.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2020.3043595","Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 105-2221-E-007 -145 -MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288723","SDN;rate allocation;flow aggregation;inapproximability;NP-hard","Bandwidth;Aggregates;Switches;Quality of service;Control systems;Resource management;Scalability","computational complexity;optimisation;quality of service;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","SDN;diverse service requirements;QoS;scalable rate allocation for aggregate flows;SRAF;scalable per-flow rate allocation;SPFRA;aggregate flow selection and flow release;AFSFR;TCP;quality of service;NP-hardness","","1","","62","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our motivation originates from the recent progresses in deep neural network (DNN) testing, which has shown that maximizing neuron coverage of DNN can help to explore possible defects of DNN (i.e., misclassification). More specifically, by treating the DNN as a program and each neuron as a functional point of the code, during the network training we aim to improve the generalization capability by maximizing the neuron coverage of DNN with the gradient similarity regularization between the original and augmented samples. As such, the decision behavior of the DNN is optimized, avoiding the arbitrary neurons that are deleterious for the unseen samples, and leading to the trained DNN that can be better generalized to out-of-distribution samples. Extensive studies on various domain generalization tasks based on both single and multiple domain(s) setting demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods. We also analyze our method by conducting visualization based on network dissection.

It can also be used as a learning tool to address the inadequacies in the current rural education system. Our application uses the available educational content and develops questions to test the students’ understanding of the fundamental concepts presented. Once students attempt to answer these questions, we assess their weaknesses by analysing their answers. Alongside the questions, we have used gamification to improve engagement with the app. We used the BERT Summarizer to extract and summarise the content. We then generate questions and use the Word2vec model to generate distractors.

Our study reveals that I/O arrivals at the block level are very complex in modern cloud storage. There is a certain degree of correlation in the long-term timescale for request arrival intervals in AliCloud and Systor'17_read. Request arrival intervals in MSRC, FIU and Systor'17_write, however, are almost uncorrelated. The Gaussianity test confirms that I/O burstiness appears to be Gaussian in AliCloud_write and Systor'17_read, but the burstiness is non-Gaussian in other workloads. Importantly, we unfold the existence of self-similarity in cloud storage workloads with a certain degree of correlations, via visual evidence, the autocorrelation structure of the aggregated process of I/O request sequences, and Hurst parameter estimates.
