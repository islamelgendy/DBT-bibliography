It generally consists in grouping similar reports through clustering techniques. However, with real-time streaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question: What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently, we study in this paper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the most relevant metrics used in the literature, we introduce DeepLsh, a Siamese DNN architecture with an original loss function, that perfectly approximates the locality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for which exact LSH solutions exist. We support this claim with a series of experiments on an original dataset, which we make available.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548326","Crash deduplication;Stack trace similarity;Approximate nearest neighbors;Locality-sensitive hashing;Siamese neural networks","Measurement;Hash functions;Computer bugs;Neural networks;Nearest neighbor methods;Search problems;Software","","","","41","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of the highest integrity level functionalities (e.g. ASIL-D in automotive), diverse redundancy must be deployed to avoid unreasonable risk of a single fault leading the system to a failure (e.g. using lockstepped cores). However, existing lockstep solutions are either (1) highly intrusive and inflexible coupling two cores with hardware means, or (2) costly in terms of execution time and monitoring if a software monitor thread checks that cores running redundantly preserve sufficient staggering. This paper presents SafeDE, a Diversity Enforcement hardware module providing light-lockstep support by means of a non-intrusive and flexible hardware module that preserves staggering across cores running redundant threads, thus bringing time diversity. SafeDE reconciles the lightness and flexibility of software-only solutions, even allowing using the cores without any lockstepping, as well as the tighter staggering of hardware-only solutions that allow using staggering values of few cycles, instead of hundreds of microseconds, as for software-only solutions. Our integration of SafeDE in a RISC-V FPGA-based space multicore from Cobham Gaisler shows that staggering is effectively preserved, and SafeDE overheads are negligible in terms of area and performance due to staggering.","1942-9401","978-1-6654-3370-9","10.1109/IOLTS52814.2021.9486715","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(grant numbers:PID2019-107255GB); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486715","","Multicore processing;Redundancy;Aerospace electronics;Hardware;Software;Safety;Task analysis","","7","","39","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are three modes in the method. For a high similarity level, the mode using temporal related frame copy (FC) to recover the lost frame is employed. When the similarity level is low, the spatially related frame is copied. Adapting to the medium similarity condition, both the similar MBs in temporal frames and the matching MBs in spatial frames are used to reconstruct the loss frame.

Diversification is a promising technique that protects the software and devices from harmful attacks and malware by making interfaces unique in each separate system. In this paper we apply diversification on the interfaces of IoT operating systems. To this aim, we introduce the diversification in post-compilation and linking phase of the software life-cycle, by shuffling the order of the linked objects while preserving the semantics of the code. This approach successfully prevents malicious exploits from producing adverse effects in the system. Besides shuffling, we also apply library symbol diversification method, and construct needed support for it e.g. into the dynamic loading phase. Besides studying and discussing memory layout shuffling and symbol diversification as a security measures for IoT operating systems, we provide practical implementations for these schemes for Thingsee OS and Raspbian operating systems and test these solutions to show the feasibility of diversification in IoT environments.","","978-1-4503-4616-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881649","software security;diversi cation;IoT","","","","","23","","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a nonnegative sparsity induced similarity measure for cluster analysis of spam images. This similarity measure is based on an assumption that a spam image should be represented well by the nonnegative linear combination of a small number of spam images in the same cluster.

This paper discusses how the balance between these two extremes is achieved as part of the ground segment and flight segment that will support the eight microsatellites of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission. The NASA CYGNSS mission aims to understand the coupling between ocean surface properties, moist atmospheric thermodynamics, radiation, and convective dynamics in the inner core of Tropical Cyclones (TCs). The mission is comprised of eight microsatellites in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at an inclination of 35 degrees. As discussed in “The CYGNSS Ground Segment: Innovative Missions Operations Concepts to Support a Micro-Satellite Constellation” [1], previously presented at IEEE Aerospace 2013, the ground segment system must take into account the unique aspects of each microsatellite, including unique Spacecraft Identification (SCID) schemes, setup of multiple ground system consoles, definition of telemetry limits unique to a microsatellite, and any unique table or command loads. This paper expands upon the previously presented paper on the ground segment, and discusses how each of these details has been addressed in the implementation of the CYGNSS mission. This includes discussion of how Spacecraft I/Ds are defined onboard via the avionics, how the FSW table configurations vary between microsatellites, and whether or not a “one-size-fits-all” approach of FSW images is necessary for each microsatellite.

However, to date, such techniques have typically been most successful when constructing short or single-edit repairs. This is true even when techniques make use of heuristic search strategies, like genetic programming, that in principle support the construction of patches of arbitrary length. One key reason is that the fitness function traditionally depends entirely on test cases, which are poor at identifying partially correct solutions and lead to a fitness landscape with many plateaus. We propose a novel fitness function that optimizes for both functionality and semantic diversity, characterized using learned invariants over intermediate behavior. Our early results show that this new approach improves semantic diversity and fitness granularity, but does not statistically significantly improve repair performance.","","978-1-7281-2268-7","10.1109/GI.2019.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823633","genetic programming;automated program repair;program semantics;invariant analysis;fitness function","Maintenance engineering;Semantics;Sociology;Statistics;Genetic programming;Computer bugs","","12","","40","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Zernike moments of a given shape are calculated as correlation values of the shape with Zernike basis functions in that all the pixels of the shape regardless of their positions contribute with the same weight to the Zernike moments. The proposed modified Zernike moment descriptor for a shape is obtained taking account of the importance of the outer form of the shape to human perception. The modified Zernike moment descriptor is obtained by first dividing the original shape into two parts of inner and outer regions with a predetermined radius and then calculating the Zernike moment of the outer part and the inner part of the shape. The proposed descriptor consists of Zernike moments of outer and inner parts. Euclidean distance is used for computing the distance measure between two shapes. For perceptual similarity-based retrieval, the Zernike moments of the outer part are used and for exact-matching retrieval, both of the outer and inner Zernike moments are used. Experimentation under various test conditions shows the effectiveness of the proposed modified Zernike moment descriptor.","","0-7803-6536-4","10.1109/ICME.2000.869602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869602","","Shape measurement;Humans;Image retrieval;Trademarks;Euclidean distance;Testing;Mobile communication;Electronics industry;Content based retrieval;Focusing","","9","","5","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when this same model is applied to a forest stand whose parameters are slightly off the modeled age curve, then the inversion fails. This paper describes the authors' efforts to develop an inversion technique for Loblolly pine stands with the natural diversity of their canopy parameters accounted for. Given a set of Loblolly pine stands from the Duke forest a set of parameters that sufficiently model the stands using MIMICS (Ulaby, et al., 1988) were developed. Next, several important parameters were chosen to be varied over a specified interval with a Gaussian distribution to allow for natural variation. This generated a large data set of 1000 different Loblolly pine canopies. MIMICS was then employed to generate the expected radar backscatter from this set at P, L, and C bands. This data, was then used to train two artificial neural networks: one to invert for the average trunk diameter and subsequently another to invert for the large branch density. This cascaded approach worked well giving errors of only a few percent for trunk diameters and 5% for branch density, when using data with trunk diameters varying between 1 cm and 10 cm. Beyond 10 cm the radar signal begins to saturate due to the high biomass, and was not invertible.<>","","0-7803-1240-6","10.1109/IGARSS.1993.322318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=322318","","Artificial neural networks;Intelligent networks;Neural networks;Radar polarimetry;Backscatter;Biomass;Radar imaging;Training data;Testing;Software measurement","","2","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the number of objectives increases, the number of mutually nondominated solutions explodes and MOEAs become invalid due to the loss of Pareto-based selection pressure. Indicator-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been proposed to address this issue by enhancing the environmental selection. Indicator-based MaOEAs are easy to implement and of good versatility, however, they are unlikely to maintain the population diversity and coverage very well. In this article, a new indicator-based MaOEA with boundary protection, namely, MaOEA-IBP, is presented to relieve this weakness. In MaOEA-IBP, a worst elimination mechanism based on the  ${I}_{{\epsilon }^{+}}$  indicator and boundary protection strategy is devised to enhance the balance of population convergence, diversity, and coverage. Specifically, a pair of solutions with the smallest  ${I}_{{\epsilon }^{+}}$  value are first identified from the population. If one solution dominates the other, the dominated solution is eliminated. Otherwise, one solution is eliminated by the boundary protection strategy. MaOEA-IBP is compared with four indicator-based algorithms (i.e.,  ${I}_{{{ {SDE}}}^{+}}$ , SRA, MaOEAIGD, and ARMOEA) and other five state-of-the-art MaOEAs (i.e., KnEA, MaOEA-CSS, 1by1EA, RVEA, and EFR-RR) on various benchmark MaOPs. The experimental results demonstrate that MaOEA-IBP can achieve competitive performance with the compared algorithms.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2960302","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871272,61471246,61976143,61672358); Project of Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2016KTSCX121); Scientific Research Foundation of Shenzhen University for newly introduced teachers(grant numbers:2019048); Zhejiang Lab’s International Talent Fund for Young Professionals; Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20170302154227954,JCGG20170414111229388,JCYJ20170302154328155); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957257","Iϵ⁺ indicator;boundary protection;convergence;coverage;diversity;evolutionary algorithm;many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA);multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)","Sociology;Statistics;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Diversity reception;Optimization;Computational complexity","","52","","70","IEEE","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the complexity of highway interchanges becomes the bottleneck for their deployment. An AV should be sufficiently tested under different highway interchanges, which is still challenging due to the lack of available datasets containing diverse highway interchanges. In this paper, we propose a model-driven method, Flyover, to generate a dataset of diverse interchanges with measurable diversity coverage. First, Flyover uses a labeled digraph to model interchange topology. Second, Flyover takes real-world interchanges as input to guarantee topology practicality and extracts different topology equivalence classes by classifying corresponding topology models. Third, for each topology class, Flyover identifies the corresponding geometrical features for the ramps and generates concrete interchanges using k-way combinatorial coverage and differential evolution. To illustrate the diversity and applicability of the generated interchange dataset, we test the built-in traffic flow control algorithm in SUMO and the fuel-optimization trajectory tracking algorithm deployed to Alibaba's autonomous trucks on the dataset. The results show that except for the geometrical difference, the interchanges are diverse in throughput and fuel consumption under the traffic flow control and trajectory tracking algorithms, respectively.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160868","Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160868","","Road transportation;Trajectory tracking;Roads;Urban areas;Feature extraction;Throughput;Topology","","3","","24","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pattern based service composition has been proven as an appealing approach to accelerate the service composition and ensure the qualities in the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) domain and can be applied to the cloud migration service composition theoretically. However, current pattern generation approaches are not applicable for the cloud migration due to lack of either existing cloud migration business process knowledge or execution logs. This paper proposes a novel approach to generate cloud migration patterns from a set of service composition solutions. We formalize the pattern generation as a special graph similarity matching problem and present an algorithm to calculate the similarity of these service composition solutions. Patterns are chosen out of the solutions by similarity with designed criteria.

More specifically, by treating the DNN as a program and each neuron as a functional point of the code, during the network training we aim to improve the generalization capability by maximizing the neuron coverage of DNN with the gradient similarity regularization between the original and augmented samples. As such, the decision behavior of the DNN is optimized, avoiding the arbitrary neurons that are deleterious for the unseen samples, and leading to the trained DNN that can be better generalized to out-of-distribution samples. Extensive studies on various domain generalization tasks based on both single and multiple domain(s) setting demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Moreover, the values of the features and/or labels of the datasets might be nonnumeric and involve vague values. Traditional learning-based prediction and classification methods cannot handle these two issues. In this study, we propose a multistep fuzzy bridged refinement domain adaptation algorithm, which offers an effective way to deal with both issues. It utilizes a concept of similarity to modify the labels of the target instances that were initially predicted by a shift-unaware model. It then refines the labels using instances that are most similar to a given target instance. These instances are extracted from mixture domains composed of source and target domains. The proposed algorithm is built on a basis of some data and refines the labels, thus performing completely independently of the shift-unaware prediction model. The algorithm uses a fuzzy set-based approach to deal with the vague values of the features and labels. Four different datasets are used in the experiments to validate the proposed algorithm. The results, which are compared with those generated by the existing domain adaptation methods, demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy in both the above-mentioned datasets.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2387872","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP 140101366,DP110103733); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001634","Classification;Domain Adaptation;Fuzzy set-based Approach;Fuzzy similarity;Transfer Learning;Classification;domain adaptation;fuzzy set-based approach;fuzzy similarity;transfer learning","Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Learning systems;Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Data models;Classification algorithms","","34","","37","IEEE","6 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous research has explored design diversity, data diversity, and duplication techniques to detect such faults in other safety-critical domains. However, these are challenging to use for AVs in practice due to significant resource overhead and design complexity. We propose, DiverseAV, a low-cost data-diversity-based redundancy technique for detecting safety-critical random hardware faults in computational elements. DiverseAV introduces data-diversity between the redundant agents by exploiting the temporal semantic consistency available in the AV sensor data. DiverseAV is a black-box technique that offers a plug-and-play solution as it requires no knowledge of the internals of the AI agent responsible for executing driving decisions, requiring little to no modification to the agent itself for achieving high coverage of transient and permanent hardware faults. It is commercially viable because it avoids software modifications to agents that are costly in terms of development and testing time. Specifically, DiverseAV distributes the sensor data between the two software agents in a round-robin manner. As a result, the sensor data for two consecutive time steps are semantically similar in terms of their worldview but significantly different at the bit level, thus ensuring the state and data diversity between the two agents necessary for detecting faults. We demonstrate DiverseAV using an open-source self-driving AI agent which is controlling a car in an open-source world simulator.","2158-3927","978-1-6654-1693-1","10.1109/DSN53405.2022.00021","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833576","","Redundancy;Vehicle safety;Semantics;Hardware;Software agents;Complexity theory;Artificial intelligence","","6","","70","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tests require students to give brief theoretical responses to the questions. Evaluation of subjective responses is based on the presence of certain facts, keywords, phrases that need to be mentioned. Traditional assessment of these tests requires an examiner to affirm the understanding of concepts by students through their answers. The human-dependant evaluation, however, is tedious, time consuming and is rarely impartial. The time constraints often mean that the examiner is unable to provide a detailed feedback to each and every student. This calls for the need to develop an objective automated grader system, which can investigate and analyze the student performances by considering different facets of learning based on semantic similarity. The enhanced BERT model, which has been fine-tuned, is utilized to capture the semantic characteristics found in the student’s response. In order to achieve this, the model compares the student’s response with the model answer and generates a model score based on the comparison. This model score is boosted through a keyword matching algorithm, which emphasizes the factual information contained within the student’s response. These final similarity scores are employed to offer comprehensive feedback that illuminates the specific areas in which the student’s comprehension may be lacking. Finally, the proposed approach is compared to other renowned algorithms like Cosine Similarity, Word Mover’s Distance, Paraphrase-mpnet, and Multi-qa-mpnet. The proposed system yields an experimental Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.11, which is significantly better as compared to other algorithms.","","979-8-3503-9447-4","10.1109/I2CT61223.2024.10543315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10543315","Subjective answer grading;Semantic similarity;Keyword matching;BERT;Deep learning;Natural language processing","Measurement;Flowcharts;Software algorithms;Semantics;Taxonomy;Prediction algorithms;Software","","","","16","IEEE","10 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there exist two problems arising from the analysis of 3D structures of proteins. The proteins with a similar sequence may have different structures, while the proteins with a similar structure may have different sequences. In the analysis of similarity in 3D structures of proteins, it remains difficult for the traditional methods using the spatial feature distribution and geometry or topology features of proteins to solve these problems. In this paper, a Tile-CNN network is proposed to analyze the similarity of proteins in 3D structure. In order to capture the overall and the local features as exhibited by the 3D structures of proteins, it projects 3D protein models into 2D protein images from different views and then cuts these 2D projected images using the tile strategy. After the training of proteins with these images in the Tile-CNN, the test protein model can be expressed by an analysis matrix, and then the similarity between 3D structures of proteins is computed using the root mean square distance (RMSD) for the benchmark matrix and the analysis matrix. As revealed by the experimental results, the proposed algorithm is more robust in analyzing the similarity of 3D structures of proteins and produces a satisfactory performance in solving the two aforementioned problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977945","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11671009); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LZ19A010002); Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KQNCX275); South China Institute of Software Engineering of Guangzhou University(grant numbers:ST201902); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9022898","3D structures;similarity;Tile-CNN;protein","Proteins;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Two dimensional displays;Analytical models;Shape;Skeleton","","1","","26","CCBY","3 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most redundancy-based program repair techniques do not reason about the repair ingredients- the code that is reused to craft a patch. We aim to reason about the repair ingredients by using code similarities to prioritize and transform statements in a codebase for patch generation. Our approach, DeepRepair, relies on deep learning to reason about code similarities. Code fragments at well-defined levels of granularity in a codebase can be sorted according to their similarity to suspicious elements (i.e., code elements that contain suspicious statements) and statements can be transformed by mapping out-of-scope identifiers to similar identifiers in scope. We examined these new search strategies for patch generation with respect to effectiveness from the viewpoint of a software maintainer. Our comparative experiments were executed on six open-source Java projects including 374 buggy program revisions and consisted of 19,949 trials spanning 2,616 days of computation time. Deep-Repair's search strategy using code similarities generally found compilable ingredients faster than the baseline, jGenProg, but this improvement neither yielded test-adequate patches in fewer attempts (on average) nor found significantly more patches (on average) than the baseline. Although the patch counts were not statistically different, there were notable differences between the nature of DeepRepair patches and jGenProg patches. The results show that our learning-based approach finds patches that cannot be found by existing redundancy-based repair techniques.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-0591-8","10.1109/SANER.2019.8668043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668043","software testing and debugging;program repair;deep learning;neural networks;code clones;language models","Maintenance engineering;Redundancy;Computer bugs;Deep learning;Transforms;Cloning;Sorting","","71","","87","IEEE","18 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a shape descriptor extraction method for volumetric data, and proposes descriptors called Neighboring Voxel Patters (NVP). These shape descriptors are computed based on voxel patterns in target volumetric data. The technique uses small local 3 x 3 x 3 voxel regions to compute all the possible voxel pattern combinations, and classifies these voxel patterns into a small number of groups. NVP descriptors are computed easily from volumetric data. Although the descriptors are small in size, these descriptors efficiently classify 3D models that are represented by volumetric data. Preliminary experiments are conducted with voxelized 3D model benchmark data.

In order to obtain more accuracy, uncertainties in the prediction of truth and falsity values are used to weight the prediction results in two steps. In the first step, the weight is used to average the truth and the falsity values whereas the weight in the second step is used to calculate the final regression output.

The fractal analysis allows studying the structure of complex objects, taking into account their qualitative specifics, for example, the relationship between the structure and the processes of its formation. When constructing a harmonic model of Titan, the method of expansion of topographic information into spherical functions was used. As a result, based on the harmonic analysis of the Cassini mission data, a topographic model of Titan was created. In the final form, the model describing Titan’s surface includes the expansion of the height parameter depending on the spherical coordinates into a slowly converging regression series of spherical harmonics. It should be emphasized that for modeling surface details of the surface on a scale of 1 degree, the order of expansion should be about 180, which requires an analysis of (180+1)2 harmonic expansion coefficients. An overdetermined topographic information system was solved to meet the regression modelling’s conditions. In this case, a number of qualitative stochastic data, such as external measures, were used together with the standard postulation of the harmonic system of the Titan model. As a result of a sampling of self-similar regions (with close values of the self-similarity coefficients) on the surface of Titan, coinciding with the SRGB parameter (characterizes the color fractal dimension), the elements of the moon’s surface were determined, which with a high degree of probability were evolutionarily formed under the influence of the same selenochemical processes.","2472-761X","978-1-6654-4503-0","10.1109/EWDTS52692.2021.9580988","Russian Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580988","digital modelling of space measurements;fractal geometry;fractal dimension of self-similar areas;an automated software package","Analytical models;Satellites;Saturn;Stochastic processes;Harmonic analysis;Fractals;Data models","","","","23","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Saturation attacks against the SDN switches and controllers are major security concerns in SD-IoT. When using the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory (DSE) to detect various saturation attacks, the simple mutual information calculation may cause information loss problem, leading to the decrease of detection accuracy. Therefore, how to avoid information loss problem to improve the detection performance is a key issue. Aiming to solve the above-mentioned issues, we propose KIND, a novel image mutual information-based decision fusion method for saturation attack detection in SD-IoT. The main idea of KIND is that it converts the probability matrix of binary classifiers to images and detects the saturation attacks by fusing these images. More specifically, when executing the evidence fusion, each evidence is converted to an image by a nonlinear transformation method. Each image is converted from the related probability-supported matrix. Then, the evidence can be fixed by comparing structural similarities among different images. After that, all evidence can be utilized to obtain the final detection results using the conducted combination rule. The evaluation results demonstrate that KIND can achieve high detection performance, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of TPR, TNR, FPR, FNR, accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, confusion matrix, ROC curves, PR curves, Chi-square test, correlation coefficient, and the quantitative strategy test.

For ranked retrieval in a collection of objects based on series of multivariate observations (e.g., searching similar video clips to a query example), satisfactory performance cannot be achieved by using many conventional similarity measures that aggregate element-to-element comparison results. Some correlation information among the individual elements has also been investigated to characterize each set of multidimensional points for comparison, but with an unwarranted assumption that the underlying data distribution has a particular parametric form. Motivated by these concerns, measuring the similarity of multidimensional point sets is approached from a novel collective perspective in this paper, by evaluating the probability that they are consistent with a same distribution. We propose to make use of nonparametric hypothesis tests in statistics to compute the distributional discrepancy of samples for assessing the degree of similarity between two ensembles of points.

Because of the particularity of hardware architecture and the weak of performance, it’s difficult to implement strong security protection measures. Traditional vulnerability analysis methods rely on manual analysis and are not suitable for large-scale vulnerability analysis.

This may result in increased system failure rates if not addressed correctly. While some of the faults are not permanent in nature, they can lead to malfunctioning in complex circuits and/or software systems. Moreover, automotive applications have recently adopted the ISO26262 to provide a standard for defining functional safety. One of the recommended schemes to tolerate faults is Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). However, traditional TMR designs typically consume too much space, power, and money all of which are undesirable for automotive. In addition, common mode faults have always been a concern in TMR which their effects would be increasing in compact systems. Errors such as noise and offset that impact a TMR sensor input can potentially cause common mode failures that lead to an entire system failure. In this paper, we introduce a new architecture and implementation for diverse TMR in a speed measurement system that would serve automotive cost and safety demands. Diversity TMR is achieved on a single chip by designing functionally identical circuits each in a different design domain to reduce the potential of common mode failures. Three versions of a speed sensing application are implemented on a mixed-signal Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) from Cypress Semiconductors.

The variety of IoT hardware architectures and software platforms requires to capture semantic equivalence of code fragments in the similarity detection. However, existing approaches are insufficient in capturing the semantic similarity. We notice that the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a function contains rich semantic information. Inspired by successful applications of natural language processing technologies in sentence semantic understanding, we propose a deep learning-based AST-encoding method, named ASTERIA, to measure the semantic equivalence of functions in different platforms. Our method leverages the Tree-LSTM network to learn the semantic representation of a function from its AST. Then the similarity detection can be conducted efficiently and accurately by measuring the similarity between two representation vectors. We have implemented an open-source prototype of ASTERIA. The Tree-LSTM model is trained on a dataset with 1,022,616 function pairs and evaluated on a dataset with 95,078 function pairs. Evaluation results show that our method outperforms the AST-based tool Diaphora and the-state-of-art method Gemini by large margins with respect to the binary similarity detection.

In this paper, we present a set of algorithms that generate numeric or soft labels to structure automatically and produce video similarity rankings. Exemplar frames are extracted from each video during the labeling process. We propose five types of learning algorithms based on the following three classes: affinity propagation, k-means or harmonic competition, and pairwise nearest-neighbor. For redundancy reduction, we also provide an algorithm that prunes excessive exemplars. The five learning algorithms produced creditable order-aware exemplar sets for the target videos. Because the content and lengths of the videos differ in terms of temporal order, we provide new methods to analyze the similarities between exemplar sets. The m-distance similarity measure is the core concept used for the global and local alignments performed on the obtained exemplar sets. Based on this comparison mechanism, we identified high-precision recall curves for all five methods. In terms of learning speed, the k-means and pairwise nearest-neighbor classes are recommendable. To facilitate similar-video retrieval, we developed a graphical user interface that accepts videos downloaded from the Web. By replacing a procedure in the software, the proposed similar-video retrieval system can accommodate more elaborate frame comparison features.","2161-4407","978-1-4799-1960-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280423","frame exemplar;numeric label;m-distance;similar-video retrieval","Floods;Redundancy;Software;Computational efficiency","","1","","17","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper provides the experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the CAF diversity combining technique. For experimental analyses, a testbed for the evaluation of multiple receive antennas based spectrum sensing is developed. The developed testbed is mainly composed of a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) / GNU Radio which is one of the software defined radio receiver, and the spectrum sensing technique is experimentally demonstrated at an anechoic chamber using 470-;710MHz frequency band allocated to ISDB-T (terrestrial digital broadcasting) in Japan.

The VMI storage management require dealing with multiple VMIs, typically in the magnitude of gigabytes, which entails VMI sprawl issues hindering the elastic resource management and provisioning. Nevertheless, existing techniques to facilitate VMI management overlook VMI semantics (i.e at the level of base image and software packages) with either restricted possibility to identify and extract reusable functionalities or with higher VMI publish and retrieval overheads. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate Expelliarmus, a novel VMI management system that helps to minimize storage, publish and retrieval overheads. To achieve this goal, Expelliarmus incorporates three complementary features. First, it makes use of VMIs modelled as semantic graphs to expedite the similarity computation between multiple VMIs. Second, Expelliarmus provides a semantic aware VMI decomposition and base image selection to extract and store non-redundant base image and software packages. Third, Expelliarmus can also assemble VMIs based on the required software packages upon user request. We evaluate Expelliarmus through a representative set of synthetic Cloud VMIs on the real test-bed. Experimental results show that our semantic-centric approach is able to optimize repository size by 2.2 - 16 times compared to state-of-the-art systems (e.g. IBM's Mirage and Hemera) with significant VMI publish and slight retrieval performance improvement.","1530-2075","978-1-7281-1246-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820973","Virtual machine image management, semantic similarity, storage optimization.","Semantics;Software packages;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Linux;Resource management;Optimization","","2","","31","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modified locust swarm algorithm avoids concentration of individuals at the current best positions, reduces the probability of premature convergence, and maintains the intensification/diversification balance. The modified spider colony algorithm models two unique behavior patterns, allows diversification of the search space for the optimal solution, and acts as a filter to reduce the influence of very good or bad solutions on the search process. Hybridization of the modified algorithms is done by combining them sequentially (preprocessor/post-processor). We experimentally tested the algorithm on seven known multivariate functions. We compared the results with competing algorithms for particle swarm, differential evolution, and colony of bees. The proposed algorithm provides better results for all considered functions. Checking the statistical significance of the results obtained using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent samples showed that the algorithm results are statistically significant.","","979-8-3503-7136-9","10.1109/Inforino60363.2024.10552010","Russian Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10552010","algorithm;global optimum;agent;locust swarm;spider colony;behavior pattern;search intensification;search diversification;test function;Wilcowon test","Memetics;Renewable energy sources;Heuristic algorithms;Metaheuristics;Search engines;Search problems;Particle swarm optimization","","","","16","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A recent differential testing of three state-of- the-art AST mapping algorithms, i.e., GumTree, MTDiff, and IJM, reveals that the algorithms generate inaccurate mappings for a considerable number of file revisions. We find that the inaccurate mappings could be caused by the mutual influence: the mappings of lower-level AST nodes (e.g., tokens) have impacts on the mappings of higher-level AST nodes (e.g., statements) and vice versa. This mutual influence issue is rarely considered by existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called iASTMapper, that iteratively map two ASTs based on the similarities between AST nodes. Given a file revision, we extract three types of AST nodes in different levels of program structures (i.e., tokens, statements, and inner-statements) from the ASTs of the two source code files. We first build mappings of the unchanged statements and inner-statements. Then, we use an iterative method to map the rest of the nodes without mapping. For each of the three types of nodes, we iteratively map the nodes based on their similarities measured using heuristic rules. We further use an iterative mechanism to connect the three iterative mapping processes by considering the mutual influence between the mappings of different types of nodes. Finally, a series of code edit actions are generated from the node mappings to help users understand and locate the code changes during revisions. We conduct experiments to compare iASTMapper with three baselines, i.e., GumTree, MTDiff, and IJM, by automatically evaluating 210,997 file revisions from ten Java projects. Furthermore, we manually evaluate the correctness of the code edit actions generated for 200 file revisions with 12 evaluators. The results demonstrate that iASTMapper outperforms the baselines. iASTMapper can generate shorter code edit actions by at least 1.29% than the baselines, with a high accuracy of 96.23%.","2643-1572","979-8-3503-2996-4","10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298413","AST mapping;Code change analysis","Java;Codes;Source coding;Software algorithms;Syntactics;Iterative algorithms;Testing","","","","36","IEEE","8 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The language generally contains abbreviations or strange words that have absolutely no connection with the word in question, this often leads to ambiguity when analysis such as sentiment analysis and Information Retrieval (IR). But lately there has been a slang dictionary that keeps a list of slang words that are often used by internet users, the dictionary informs slang words into words in formal Indonesian. But there are still many studies, especially text mining that ignores or does not filter out the word slang so that it will likely affect the results in research that has been done. The Nazief & Adriani algorithm is an algorithm to transform basic forms using Indonesian morphology by eliminating prefixes and suffixes. The Ratcliff/Obershelp algorithm can determine the similarity between two strings by matching the two strings. The purpose of this study is to compare the word slang to the formal word Indonesian, it aims to find out the similarity between the word slang with the formal word so that it will be known the percentage level of slang similarity with the formal word to find out whether the formal basic word can indirectly representing the word slang with the degree of similarity. The dataset used by Kaggle and Github, the results of the study of the use of text preprocessing and stemming of the Nazief & Adriani algorithm affect the similarity of slang and formal words with the most frequent distribution in the range of values 0.8-0.89 (80% -89.99%) in three different tests with two types of datasets and affect the level of similarity of strings precisely on the dataset from Kaggle at the value of similarity 1 (100%) which previously amounted to 40 data to 927 data, the dataset from Github also increased to the value of similarity 1 (100%) which previously did not have data to 409 data.","","978-1-7281-7356-6","10.1109/ICOIACT50329.2020.9331973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331973","Nazief & Adriani;Ratcliff/Obershelp;Similarity;Colloquial","Text mining;Sentiment analysis;Dictionaries;Social networking (online);Transforms;Software development management;Testing","","3","","21","IEEE","29 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By far, recognizing similar components in binary code remains a challenge. Existing research employs either static or dynamic approaches to capture program syntax or semantics-level features for comparison. However, there exist multiple design limitations in previous work, which result in relatively high cost, low accuracy and scalability, and thus severely impede their practical use. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages in-memory fuzzing for binary code similarity analysis. Our prototype tool IMF-SIM applies in-memory fuzzing to launch analysis towards every function and collect traces of different kinds of program behaviors. The similarity score of two behavior traces is computed according to their longest common subsequence. To compare two functions, a feature vector is generated, whose elements are the similarity scores of the behavior trace-level comparisons. We train a machine learning model through labeled feature vectors; later, for a given feature vector by comparing two functions, the trained model gives a final score, representing the similarity score of the two functions. We evaluate IMF-SIM against binaries compiled by different compilers, optimizations, and commonly-used obfuscation methods, in total over one thousand binary executables. Our evaluation shows that IMF-SIM notably outperforms existing tools with higher accuracy and broader application scopes.","","978-1-5386-2684-9","10.1109/ASE.2017.8115645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115645","In-memory fuzzing;code similarity;reverse engineering;taint analysis","Binary codes;Tools;Runtime;Indexes;Syntactics","","27","","65","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications that depend on an IP similarity measure include measuring correlation between security alerts, building baselines for behavioral modelling, debugging network failures and tracking persistent attacks. However, IPs do not have a natural similarity measure by definition. Deep Learning architectures are a promising solution here since they are able to learn numerical representations for IPs directly from data, allowing various distance measures to be applied on the calculated representations. Current works have utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for learning IP embeddings. However, these approaches have no systematic way to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) IPs not seen during training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for IP embedding using an adapted graph neural network (GNN) architecture. This approach has the advantages of working on the raw data, scalability and, most importantly, induction, i.e. the ability to measure similarity between previously unseen IPs. Using data from an enterprise network, our approach is able to identify high similarities between local DNS servers and root DNS servers even though some of these machines are never encountered during the training phase.","","978-1-7281-9486-8","10.1109/CloudNet51028.2020.9335789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9335789","","Training;Current measurement;Natural language processing;Graph neural networks;IP networks;Servers;Task analysis","","1","","21","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the local contrast and intensity change over time, the registration criterion needs to be chosen carefully. We propose a measure based on Normalized Gradient Fields (NGF) in order to obtain registration. Since this measure requires strong gradients in the images, we also test combining the measure with the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) to maintain registration forces over the whole image area. To ensure smoothness, we employ a Laplacian regularizer and use the B-spline based approach to describe the transformation of the image space. Our experiments show that by using NGF good registration results can be obtained for image exhibiting a high intensity contrast. For images with a low intensity contrast, combining NGF and SSD improves the registration results significantly over using NGF only.

An exploratory study is performed in this paper, to explore the relationship and effects of interface similarity in code clones. It is investigated that interface similarity can be helpful for code clone detection. First, clone methods are detected in code repositories. Then, interface information is extracted from source code and several interface similarities are measured using that information. The experimental corpus contains three different types of code repositories with 35, 109 and 24,558 Java projects respectively. The detected clone pairs in three code repositories are, on average 57,457, 102,745 and 123,576 respectively. Promising results are found as it shows on average 87.91% intra-project and 59.17% inter-project clones contain similar interfaces (i.e., return types and at least one keyword and one parameter type are similar). Besides, the average similarity of interfaces in Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 clones are 100%, 83.47% and 81.90% respectively. These results prove the strong relationship between code clones and interface similarities. In future, it can be useful to design and develop interface driven clone detection tools.","","978-1-5386-2649-8","10.1109/APSECW.2017.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8312535","Code Clone;Clone Detection;Exploratory Study","Cloning;Java;Tools;Data mining;Information technology;Electronic mail;Benchmark testing","","6","","25","IEEE","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our method, we first transform the schema matching problem into a tree matching problem by transforming schemas to be matched into labeled (including node label and edge label) trees. The similarity measure considers element categories and properties. In order to get an optimal matching, we compute the structural similarity value based on the neighbors of each element (ancestor, children, and sibling).

A hierarchical model is generated solely based on the geometry information of a 3D CAD model of the object. The approach does not rely on texture or reflectance information of the object's surface, making it useful for a wide range of industrial and robotic applications, e.g., bin-picking. A hierarchical view-based approach that addresses typical problems of previous methods is applied: It handles true perspective, is robust to noise, occlusions, and clutter to an extent that is sufficient for many practical applications, and is invariant to contrast changes. For the generation of this hierarchical model, a new model image generation technique by which scale-space effects can be taken into account is presented. The necessary object views are derived using a similarity-based aspect graph. The high robustness of an exhaustive search is combined with an efficient hierarchical search. The 3D pose is refined by using a least-squares adjustment that minimizes geometric distances in the image, yielding a position accuracy of up to 0.12 percent with respect to the object distance, and an orientation accuracy of up to 0.35 degree in our tests. The recognition time is largely independent of the complexity of the object, but depends mainly on the range of poses within which the object may appear in front of the camera. For efficiency reasons, the approach allows the restriction of the pose range depending on the application. Typical runtimes are in the range of a few hundred ms.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112769","3D object recognition;machine vision;aspect graphs;similarity measures;hierarchical;models;robotics;industrial automation;image generation;projections;shape;feature measurement;least squares methods;perspective.","Solid modeling;Three dimensional displays;Cameras;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Robustness;Design automation","","111","1","46","IEEE","27 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Medical image registration relies on similarity measure which is low between PET/CT image voxels and therefore PET/CT registration is a challenging task. To address this issue, this paper presents an unsupervised end-to-end method, DenseRegNet, for deformable 3D PET/CT image registration. The method consists of two stages: (1) predicting 3D displacement vector field (DVF); and (2) registering 3D image. In the 3D DVF prediction stage, a two-level similarity measure together with a deformation regularization is proposed as loss function to optimize network training.In the image registration stage, a resampler and a spatial transformer are utilized to obtain the registration results. In this paper, 663 pairs of Uptake Value (SUV) and Hounsfield Unit (Hu) patches of 106 patients, 227 pairs of SUV and Hu patches of 35 patients and 259 pairs of SUV and Hu patches of 35 patients are randomly selected as training, validation and test set, respectively. Normalized cross correlation (NCC), intersection over union (IoU) of liver bounding box and euclidean distance (ED) on landmark points are used to evaluate the registration results. Experiment results show that the proposed method, DenseRegNet, achieves the best results in terms of liver bounding box IoU and ED, and the second highest value of NCC. For a trained model, given a new pair of PET/CT images, the registration result can be obtained with only one forward calculation within 10 seconds. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that, compared with other deep learning registration models, the proposed DenseRegNet achieves improved results in the challenging deformable PET/CT registration task.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961268","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872075); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(grant numbers:26108005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937543","PET/CT registration;unsupervised learning;two-level similarity measure;deformation regularization","Three-dimensional displays;Computed tomography;Image registration;Task analysis;Strain;Biomedical imaging;Training","","9","","29","CCBY","20 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here the observed input value A' does not have to exactly match the antecedent value A in order to produce the output B' which does not have to exactly match B. This paper examines the traditional fuzzy inferencing method for fuzzy control that is similarity-based and uses Zadeh's consistency or partial matching index and distance-based methods, one referred to as geometric compatibility modification (GCM) and the other transformation constraint-based generalized modus ponens (T-CGMP).

To deal with data uncertainty, probabilistic databases can be used to store uncertain data, and querying facilities are provided to yield answers with confidence. However, the results from a query or mining process may not be reliable when the uncertainty propagates in the systems. In this paper, we leverage the power of crowdsourcing by designing a set of Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs in short, to ask a crowd to improve the quality of uncertain data. In particular, we consider crowds consists of workers with diverse accuracy rates when answering the HITs. We design solutions to maximize the data quality with minimal number of HITs. There are two obstacles for this non-trivial optimization, which lead to very high computational cost for selecting the optimal set of HITs. First, members of a crowd may return incorrect answers with different probabilities. Second, the HITs decomposed from uncertain data are often correlated. We have addressed these challenges in this paper by designing an effective approximation algorithm and an efficient heuristic solution, especially for crowds with diverse individual accuracy rates. To further improve the efficiency, we derive tight lower and upper bounds for effective filtering and estimation. Extensive experiments on both a simulated crowd and a real crowdsourcing platform are conducted to evaluate our solutions.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.3027545","Hong Kong RGC GRF(grant numbers:16202218,C6030-18G,C1031-18G,C5026-18G); AOE(grant numbers:AoE/E-603/18); China NSFC(grant numbers:61729201,61806132); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B151530001); Hong Kong ITC ITF(grant numbers:ITS/044/18FX,ITS/470/18FX); Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Research; Didi-HKUST joint research lab; Shenzhen University; Tencent Rhino-Bird Young Faculty Open Fund; Wechat; Webank Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210063","Crowdsourcing;cleaning uncertain data;approximation algorithm;heuristic algorithm","Crowdsourcing;Cleaning;Uncertainty;Data integrity;Approximation algorithms;Urban areas;Databases","","3","","45","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results also reveal that different quantities of contribution from different application protocols in the traffic load can also change traffic's self-similar characteristics.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2005.1642430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642430","FTP;http;Self-similarity;SMTP;TCP","Electronic mail;Programmable control;Hardware;DC motors;Irrigation;Choppers;IEC;Ethernet networks;Software testing;Impedance","","","","19","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several techniques have been proposed by researchers to perform bot detection, but most of them are limited to identifying bots performing specific activities, let alone distinguishing between GitHub App and OAuth App. In this paper, we propose a bot detection technique for OAuth App, named BDGOA. 24 features are used in BDGOA, which can be divided into three dimensions: account information, account activity, and text similarity. To better explore the behavioral features, we define a fine-grained classification of behavioral events and introduce self-similarity to quantify the repeatability of behavioral sequence. We leverage five machine learning classifiers on the benchmark dataset to conduct bot detection, and finally choose random forest as the classifier, which achieves the highest F1-score of 95.83%. The experimental results comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches also demonstrate the superiority of BDGOA.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2023.0006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10286551","Github;DevBots;machine learning;text similarity","Stability criteria;Stars;Benchmark testing;Chatbots;Feature extraction;Robustness;Behavioral sciences","","","","30","","16 Oct 2023","","","TUP","TUP Journals"
"Architectural characterization and similarity analysis of sunspider and Google's V8 Javascript benchmarks","D. Tiwari; Y.

However, due to bytecode interpretation, Javascript codes suffer from severe performance penalty (up to 50x slower) compared to the corresponding native C/C++ code. We recognize that the first step to bridge this performance gap is to understand the the architectural execution characteristics of Javascript benchmarks. Therefore, this paper presents an in-depth architectural characterization of widely used V8 and Sunspider Javascript benchmarks using Google's V8 javascript engine. Using statistical data analysis techniques, our characterization study discovers and explains correlation among different execution characteristics in microarchitecture dependent as well as microarchitecture independent fashion. Furthermore, our study measures (dis)similarity among 33 different Javascript benchmarks and discusses its implications. Given the widespread use of Javascripts, we believe our findings are useful for both performance analysis and benchmarking communities.","","978-1-4673-1146-5","10.1109/ISPASS.2012.6189228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189228","","Benchmark testing;Principal component analysis;Microarchitecture;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Cryptography;Google","","15","","43","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
