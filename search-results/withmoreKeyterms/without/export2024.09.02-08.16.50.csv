Some discussions about NLP are widely used, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to summarize papers with many sentences in them. Siamese Similarity is a term that applies repetitive twin network architecture to machine learning for sentence similarity. This architecture is also called Manhattan LSTM, which can be applied to the case of detecting paraphrase sentences. The paraphrase sentence must be recognized by machine learning first. Word2vec is used to convert sentences to vectors so they can be recognized in machine learning. This research has developed paraphrase sentence detection using Siamese Similarity with word2vec embedding. The experimental results showed that the amount of training data is dominant to the new data compared to the number of times and the variation in training data. Obtained data accuracy, 800,000 pairs provide accuracy reaching 99% of training data and 82.4% of new data.

The compiler automatically generates custom instructions in the security critical segments of the program, and the instructions execute on the RISC-V custom co-processor to produce diversified timing characteristics on each execution instance. CIDPro has been implemented on the Zynq7000 XC7Z020 FPGA device to study the performance overhead and security tradeoffs.

Frequent pattern mining techniques are extensively studied in numerous domains, including market basket data analysis, data mining, recommender system, web log mining, sequential pattern mining, and software bug detection. In frequent itemset mining, the support-based framework is frequently used to find itemsets with a frequency over a predetermined threshold. Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat, FP-Max, SaM and Relim are a few of the FPM algorithms that have been created to efficiently search for frequent itemsets in datasets. While FP-Growth utilizes a tree-based approach and does not require candidate generation, the Apriori method generates candidate itemsets using a level- wise search strategy and the Apriori property. Eclat employs an equivalence class clustering and lattice traversal technique, while FP-Max focuses on mining maximal frequent itemsets. Relim is a list-based, result-driven mining technique, while SaM is used to mine associative rules. A review and comparison of numerous frequent pattern mining algorithms, including Apriori, FP- growth, Eclat, FP-max, COFI, SaM, and ReLim, are presented in this paper. Using a variety of real-time datasets with unique properties, we provide an in-depth study of these frequent itemset mining algorithms. The algorithms are evaluated according to factors such as the total number of database scans needed, candidate generation techniques, and sensitivity to changes in user-defined parameters like support. Real-life datasets including Chess, Retail, Kaggle, Market Basket, and Technical datasets, are used for the analysis. The results emphasize each algorithm’s insights into how effective and efficient each algorithm is. The objective of the present research is to increase effectiveness and efficiency frequent pattern mining algorithms. In this paper we are presenting a comparative study and analysis of apriori algorithm, fp-growth, Fp-max, Eclat, SaM, ReLim algorithm. Python and the Anaconda environment are used to carry out the analysis and comparison of FIM algorithms. This research aims to contribute to the development of more effective frequent pattern mining algorithm.","","979-8-3503-4438-7","10.1109/ICAICCIT60255.2023.10466004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10466004","Data mining;Frequent patterns;Frequent pattern mining (FPM);support;itemset;Apriori;Eclat;FP-Max;SaM;Relim","Sensitivity;Itemsets;Databases;Software algorithms;Computer bugs;Clustering algorithms;Software","","","","30","IEEE","20 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, like other stochastic methods, PSO also encounters the problems of entrapment into local optima and premature convergence in solving complex multimodal problems. To tackle these issues, a diversity-guided multi-mutation particle swarm optimizer (abbreviated as DMPSO) is presented in this paper. To start with, the chaos opposition-based learning (OBL) is employed to yield high-quality initial particles to accelerate the convergence speed of DMPSO. Followed by, the self-regulating inertia weight is leveraged to strike a balance between the exploration and exploitation in the search space. After that, three different kinds of mutation strategies (gaussian, cauchy and chaotic mutations) are used to maintain the potential diversity of the whole swarm based on an effective diversity-guided mechanism. In particular, an auxiliary velocity-position update mechanism is exclusively applied to the global best particle that can effectively guarantee the convergence of the DMPSO. Finally, extensive experiments on a set of well-known unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions demonstrate that DMPSO outperforms most of the other tested PSO variants in terms of both the solution quality and its efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2938063","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2013CB329502); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971005); Tianchenghuizhi Fund for Innovation and Promotion of Education(grant numbers:2018A03036); Key Research and Development Program of the Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2018GY-037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8817908","Particle swarm optimization;opposition-based learning;swarm diversity;inertial weight;premature convergence;local optima;mutation strategy","Convergence;Particle swarm optimization;Acceleration;Sociology;Statistics;Standards;Chaos","","19","","81","CCBY","28 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from existing methods building more than one local metric directly, however in this paper, we emphasize the effect of the global metric when generating those local ones. Since local metrics can be considered as types of amendments which describe the biases towards localities based on some commonly shared characteristic, it is expected that the performance of every single local metric for a specified locality can be “lifted” when learning with the global jointly. Following this consideration, we propose the Local metrIcs Facilitated Transformation (Lift) framework, where an adaptive number of local transformations are constructed with the help of their global counterpart. Generalization analyses not only reveal the relationship between the global and local metrics but also indicate when and why the framework works theoretically. In the implementation of Lift, locality anchored centers assist the decomposition of multiple local views, and a diversity regularizer is proposed to reduce the redundancy among biases. Empirical classification comparisons reveal the superiority of the Lift idea.

In population-based optimization methods, the generation of diverse individuals holds utmost importance for adequately exploring the problem landscape, particularly in highly multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems. Our study reveals that, in line with findings from sev-eral prior research papers, commonly employed crossover and mutation operations lack the capability to generate high-quality diverse individuals and tend to become confined to limited areas around various local optima. This paper introduces an augmen-tation to the diversity of the population in the well-established multi-objective scheme of the genetic algorithm, NSGA-II. This enhancement is achieved through two key components: the genuine initialization method and the substitution of the worst individuals with new randomly generated individuals as a re-initialization approach in each generation. The proposed multi-objective feature selection method undergoes testing on twelve real-world classification problems, with the number of features ranging from 2,400 to nearly 50,000.

Constructing learner communities of interest is critical and necessary to implementing cooperative learning in an e-learning environment. This paper proposes a method for community construction which put the learners with similar interest together to form communities. Here, the similarity between two learners is measured by computing the cosine of the angle between their rating vectors. To address the problems of sparsity in the rating data set, a learner's ratings on the learning objects which he has not rated is predicted by the similarity of objects. Experimental results derived from real learner data have shown that this method can organize learners properly and efficiently.","","978-1-4244-3520-3","10.1109/ICCSE.2009.5228247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228247","e-learning;e-learning community;similarity;rating prediction","Electronic learning;Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Collaboration;Testing;Buildings;Courseware;Education Society;Scheduling","","","","12","IEEE","1 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is puzzling since academic security researchers have published scores of papers claiming to advance the state of the art in the area of code randomization. Unfortunately, these improved diversity techniques are generally less deployable than integrity-based techniques, such as control-flow integrity, due to their limited compatibility with existing optimization, development, and distribution practices. This paper contributes yet another diversity technique called pagerando. Rather than trading off practicality for security, we first and foremost aim for deployability and interoperability. Most code randomization techniques interfere with memory sharing and deduplication optimization across processes and virtual machines, ours does not. We randomize at the granularity of individual code pages but never rewrite page contents. This also avoids incompatibilities with code integrity mechanisms that only allow signed code to be mapped into memory and prevent any subsequent changes. On Android, pagerando fully adheres to the default SELinux policies. All practical mitigations must interoperate with unprotected legacy code, our implementation transparently interoperates with unmodified applications and libraries. To support our claims of practicality, we demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into and protect all shared libraries shipped with stock Android 6.0. We also consider hardening of non-shared libraries and executables and other concerns that must be addressed to put software diversity defenses on par with integrity-based mitigations such as CFI.","","978-1-5090-5589-0","10.1109/SecDev.2016.036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839805","Exploit mitigation;code randomization;memory sharing;Android;software diversity","Libraries;Benchmark testing;Androids;Humanoid robots;Registers;Browsers;Security","","7","1","39","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe a light-weight, automatic debugging-based technique, coined extended spectrum-based fault localization for MAS (ESFL-MAS), that shortens the diagnostic process, while only relying on minimal information about the system. ESFL-MAS uses a heuristic that quantifies the suspiciousness of an agent to be faulty. Different heuristics may have a different impact on the diagnostic quality of ESFL-MAS. Our experimental evaluation shows that 10 out of 42 heuristics (namely accuracy, coverage, Jaccard, Laplace, least contradiction, Ochiai, Rogers and Tanimoto, simple-matching, Sorensen-dice, and support) yield the best diagnostic accuracy (96.26% on average) in the context of the MAS used in our experiments.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2523905","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; Portuguese Agency for Research and Development(grant numbers:SFRH/BD/66717/2009); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Brazilian Agency for Research and Development(grant numbers:BEX 9382-13-5); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458176","Fault diagnosis;multiagent systems (MASs);reliability;spectrum-based fault localization (SFL)","Java;Context;Software;Multi-agent systems;Fault diagnosis","","2","","48","IEEE","22 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method involves several steps. First, we clean and organize defect-related knowledge, defining concepts of defect entities, attributes, and relationships to establish a code defect knowledge graph. Next, using abstract syntax trees, we extract various information from the code, including control flow diagrams, control dependency graphs, data dependency graphs, program dependency graphs, and code attribute graphs, to capture relevant details about nodes and edges. Based on the structural and logical information represented by node-edge associations, we employ the Deepwalk algorithm to construct a directed graph of the code and generate random walk sequences. These sequences serve as a foundation for learning and vector representation. Finally, we compare the vector similarities between the generated representations and a candidate code list from the defect knowledge graph, which has undergone initial semantic threshold filtering. By querying the defect labels of the most similar code in the defect code knowledge graph, we determine whether the code under inspection contains defects. Experimental results reveal that DDMB improves defect detection accuracy by 2.02% compared to existing methods. Additionally, it enhances the interpretability and reliability of defect detection while facilitating multi-dimensional analysis of code defects, thus providing better support for practical applications.","2837-7109","979-8-3503-1725-1","10.1109/ICCC59590.2023.10507664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10507664","knowledge graph;deepwalk;defect detection;DDMB;code similarity","Software testing;Codes;Semantics;Knowledge graphs;Static analysis;Syntactics;Vectors","","","","26","IEEE","30 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the success of existing methods in optimizing various numerical functions, their capability to accurately measure the similarity among practical trajectory optimization problems (TOPs) remains limited due to the complex nature of real-world scenarios. To alleviate their limitations, this paper proposes a clustering-based similarity measurement method for ESTO, aiming to accurately select promising source solutions to speed up the evolutionary search in solving TOPs. Specifically, all candidate source TOPs that have been optimized are first categorized into different clusters based on their populations via k-means clustering. Afterward, the populations of source TOPs in the same cluster are employed to compute the similarity of these source TOPs to the target TOP that is being optimized. In this way, the TOPs with the highest similarity can be identified and their optimized solutions will be injected into the population of the target task for faster convergence. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches, thereby confirming its capability to improve the optimization performance and efficiency in solving practical TOPs.","","979-8-3503-5409-6","10.1109/CAI59869.2024.00229","Hong Kong Polytechnic University; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10605476","Evolutionary sequential transfer optimization;similarity measurement;trajectory optimization problems","Sociology;Search problems;Task analysis;Statistics;Artificial intelligence;Trajectory optimization;Convergence","","","","36","IEEE","30 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given triplets like “aircraft” is similar to “bird” than “train”, Weakly Supervised Conditional Similarity Learning (WS-CSL) learns multiple embeddings to match semantic conditions without explicit condition labels such as “can fly”. However, similarity relationships in a triplet are uncertain except providing a condition. For example, the previous comparison becomes invalid once the conditional label changes to “is vehicle”. To this end, we introduce a novel evaluation criterion by predicting the comparison's correctness after assigning the learned embeddings to their optimal conditions, which measures how much WS-CSL could cover latent semantics as the supervised model. Furthermore, we propose the Distance Induced Semantic COndition VER-ification Network (DiscoverNet), which characterizes the instance-instance and triplets-condition relations in a “decompose-and-fuse” manner. To make the learned embeddings cover all semantics, Discovernet utilizes a set module or an additional regularizer over the correspondence between a triplet and a condition. DiscoverNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like UT-Zappos-50k and Celeb-A w.r.t. different criteria.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-6946-3","10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878949","Representation learning; Self-& semi-& meta- & unsupervised learning","Computer vision;Semantics;Benchmark testing;Predictive models;Birds;Pattern recognition;Aircraft","","3","","49","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many studies have been conducted to examine the credibility of the publication through social networking sites, especially through Twitter in different languages, but the research in Arabic is few and needs further development. In this research, we focus on discovering the credibility of Twitter publishing in Arabic by integrating the Social Media Mining techniques with the Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Methods: We construct the similarity graph using embedded features of the input image (i.e., Non-Demented (ND), Very Mild Demented (VMD), Mild Demented (MD), and Moderated Demented (MDTD)). We experiment and compare different dimension-reduction and clustering algorithms to construct the best similarity graph to capture the similarity between the same class images using the cosine distance as a similarity measure. We utilize the similarity graph to present (sample) the training data to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use the similarity graph as a regularizer in the loss function of a CNN model to minimize the distance between the input images and their k-nearest neighbours in the similarity graph while minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss between the training image predictions and the actual image class labels. Results: We conduct a baseline experiment with a standard, none-tuned VGG-19 CNN model with different settings and compare the results to identify the best settings to classify (ND vs VMD vs MD vs MDTD). Conclusion: Our method achieves an adequate performance on the testing dataset (accuracy = 0.71, area under receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.86, F1 measure = 0.71). Significance: The classification results show that utilizing a structural similarity graph with none tuned standard CNN model can achieve adequate prediction accuracy and motivate fine-tuning several pre-trained models for better classification performance.","","978-1-6654-3875-9","10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9599144","Alzheimer's Disease;Convolutional Neural Network;Graph-Regularization;Magnetic Resonance Images;Learning Structural Similarity","Training;Magnetic resonance;Training data;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease","","3","","28","IEEE","17 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This reduces the probability of signal detection at an adversarial receiver. Moreover, random sequence selection and time-dithering are both proven to be potent methods for reducing cyclic correlations and can combine to provide a 94.6% reduction in DCS at the receiver.

To validate parameter setting, we emulate Elephanta under 5 thousand throughput traces including FCC broadband, 3G HSDPA data set from the Internet and 4G/LTE data set collected by ourselves. Accordingly, we implement Elephanta in dash.js at client side for user test.

Link-based navigation and keyword-based search methods used on wiki environments suffer from many limitations. To support informal learning on these environments, it is important to provide easy and fast access to relevant content. However, the massive diversity of unstructured content and user base on these environments pose major challenges when designing recommendation models. To the best of our knowledge, no effective personalized content recommendation approach has yet been defined to support informal learning on wikis. We propose an effective personalized content recommendation framework (PCRF) in addition to an evaluation framework that can be used to evaluate the impact of personalized content recommendations on informal learning from wikis. PCRF implements an efficient structural recommendation model by integrating fuzzy thesauri with adaptive users' interest models generated using structural analysis of topical navigational graphs. We design user studies with multiple strategies and treatments to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework and assess the impact of recommendations on informal learning. Experiments show that PCRF generates highly relevant recommendations adaptive to changes in users' interests using the HARD model with MAP@k scores 86.4-100%. An evaluation of informal learning revealed that users of Wikipedia with personalized support could achieve higher scores on a conceptual knowledge assessment with an average score of 14.9 compared with 10.0 for users who used the encyclopedia without recommendations.

Existing methods have adopted pre-trained language models (PLMs) and achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, due to the Dropout strategy, the PLM-based models suffer from inconsistency between the training and testing stages, i.e., the semantic representation during training is inconsistent with the counterpart during testing. Besides, the PLM-based models prefer to correct the erroneous characters to semantically proper or commonly used ones rather than the ground truths. And they usually neglect phonological and visual similarity knowledge between characters. In this paper, we propose a consistent and contrastive learning approach with character similarity for CSC (CCCSpell). CCCSpell is composed of a BERT-based detector and a character similarity-based corrector. The detector uses bidirectional Kullback-Leibler divergence to minimize the gap between the output distributions of two sub-models sampled by Dropout, which can enhance the consistency of the semantic representations when training and inferring to improve the testing performance. Besides, the detector employs a contrastive optimization objective to increase the confidence of targets and decrease the counterpart of common characters, which can help avoid predicting common ones. After that, the corrector tries to incorporate phonological and visual similarity knowledge into detection results by calculating the levenshtein edit distance between the shape/pronunciation representations of characters, and utilizes the confusion set to help select golden characters. Experiments are conducted on SIGHAN and OCR datasets, and the results demonstrate that CCCSpell outperforms all baseline models and achieves new state-of-the-art performances.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191137","","Training;Visualization;Semantics;Optical character recognition;Neural networks;Detectors;Task analysis","","","","29","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the pre-processing stage, the colour (R-G-B) images are extracted to three channel images (i.e. R, G and B) containing spatial pixel intensities. The images corresponding to each channel are stored as pixels values, each pixel value represents a colour intensity value. Histograms are frequency distribution (counts) of these intensity values that occur spatially. During training phase, the thermal tomographic image histogram for each channel (R, G and B) of desired heating quality are generated and stored. In testing phase, the unknown thermal tomographic image histogram is compared with trained histograms following histogram similarity method, which computes the overlapping area between the trained histogram and unknown histogram curves. The result shows that the area reaches maximum values for similar thermal images. The likeness for the similarity of the test image as captured are found out histogram similarity factors i.e. area of overlapped histogram curves, histogram-distance and skewness-kurtosis based similarity between the histograms. Heating quality (e.g. uniform or non-uniform) is then assessed based upon these found out histogram similarity factor values viz. an unknown test image has got the most similarity with that known heating class database which has got the maximum Histogram intersection percentage, minimum mean Euclidean distance between the normalised histograms and minimum mean Distance (Skewness-Kurtosis) measure.","","978-1-6654-6242-6","10.1109/CALCON56258.2022.10060021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060021","Tomography;Histogram Similarity Factors;Skewness;Kurtosis","Temperature measurement;Training;Histograms;Temperature distribution;Image color analysis;Furnaces;Tomography","","","","20","IEEE","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rate-distortion optimization is widely used in modern video codecs to make various encoder decisions to optimize the rate-distortion tradeoff. Typically, the distortion measure used is either sum-of-square error or sum-of-absolute distance, both of which are convenient when used in the RDO framework but not always reflective of a perceptual visual quality. We show that SSIM can be used as the distortion metric in the RDO framework in a simple, yet effective, manner by scaling the Lagrange multiplier used in RDO based on the local variance in that region. The experimental results on the H.264/AVC reference software show that compared to traditional RDO approaches, for the same SSIM score, the proposed approach can achieve an average rate reduction of about 9% and 14% for random access and low-delay encoding configurations. At the same time, there is no significant change in the encoding runtime.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2240918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413191","Perceptual-based coding;rate-distortion optimization (RDO);structural similarity index (SSIM);video coding","Measurement;Encoding;Computational modeling;Quantization;Visualization;Optimization;Video coding","","58","","35","IEEE","16 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation reuse can potentially improve simulation quality, cost, and delivery. However, identifying reusable simulations is a difficult task, of ten manual and based on limited information. This paper presents a method to facilitate the reuse of specific parts of past simulations. The system to simulate is compared to systems which have already been simulated. The comparison, which permits to identify similar chains of components in the systems’ block diagrams, is formalized as inexact graph matching. The comparison takes into account standardized tags as well as block properties defined by a name, a value, and a unit. Similar systems are identified with a limited computational cost. When two systems are similar, a mapping between their components and interactions can be obtained at a higher computational cost. A software prototype is implemented to perform the necessary computations, visualize the results, and accordingly select the simulation parts to reuse. The software prototype is tested with the block diagram of an autonomous electric car. Similar chains of components are successfully identified in the powertrain of a non-autonomous electric car represented in a past simulation. The corresponding part of the past simulation can then be selected for reuse.","","978-1-6654-3441-6","10.1109/RASSE53195.2021.9686864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686864","diagram;graph;inexact matching;MBSE;reuse;simulation","Computational modeling;Prototypes;Mechanical power transmission;Manuals;Software;Computational efficiency;Topology","","1","","16","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies show that hardware diversification can detect software attacks by checking the consistency of their behavior simultaneously. Unfortunately, the severe performance degradation and extra system costs caused by these methods are unacceptable in many applications. This paper presents a hardware-level, lockstep shadow thread framework to enrich the diversity of the software execution, with the facilitation from programmable hardware decoder and novel CPU support of tightly coupled shadow thread technique. Specifically, given a piece of (legacy) binary code, we first generate diversified binary versions using an offline binary rewriter and programmable hardware binary translator at runtime. Two diversified binary code images are launched as dual simultaneous threads in the hardware layer with one as the primary thread and the other one as shadow thread. Instructions from the shadow thread are not executed but just compared, and thus incur no OS side-effects. The extended CPU is able to decode instructions from both threads, and dispatch them to the next stage pipeline for a lockstep comparison. Any mismatch of the decoded instructions from the two threads caused by remotely injected binary code will be detected. Our design provides instruction set randomization (ISR) with minimal cost in performance, when compared with straightforward ISR implementation. The simulation results indicate that our framework incurs very small overheads and provides a protection against code injection attacks.","1558-1101","978-3-9815370-2-4","10.7873/DATE.2014.064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800265","","Instruction sets;Hardware;Binary codes;Benchmark testing;Decoding;Radiation detectors;Pipelines","","","","24","","21 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After dive a significant drop of spirometric indexes forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) over the group as a whole was found. The significant increase of individual FETND, exceeding the natural variability limit, was found in 10 subjects (20.8%). Three of them during dive had respiratory symptoms characteristic for initial manifestations of pulmonary oxygen poisoning. Two of them had essential drop of FEV1. The asymptomatic reversible increase of FETND in the rest 7 divers was interpreted as a sign of obstructive impairments caused by hidden phase of hyperbaric hyperoxia effect.

Systems for automatic essay assessment have been commercially available since 1990's. However, the progress in the field was obstructed by a lack of qualitative information regarding the effectiveness of such systems. Most of the research in automatic essay grading has been associated with English writing due to its widespread use and the availability of more learner collection and language processing software for the language. In addition, there is large number of commercial software for grading programming assignments automatically. In this work, we investigate document semantic similarity based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use an open-source Python software, Gensim, to develop and implement an essay grading system able to compare an essay to an answer-key and assign to it a grade based on semantic similarity between the two. We test our tool on variable-size essays and conduct experimental tests to compare the results obtained from human grader (professor) and those obtained from the automatic grading system. Results show high correlation between the professor grades and the grades assigned by both modeling techniques. However, LSA-based modeling showed more promising results than the LDA-based method.","","978-0-7381-1180-3","10.1109/SNAMS52053.2020.9336533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9336533","Machine Learning;Latent Semantic Analysis;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Semantic Similarity","Social networking (online);Semantics;Tools;Writing;Resource management;Security;Python","","12","","43","IEEE","3 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the use of SM is motivated by its low-complexity implementation in comparison to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, achieved through the activation of a single antenna during transmission. Moreover, energy detection-based communications restrict the channel state information to the magnitude of the fading gains. This consideration makes the design applicable for low-cost low-powered devices since phase estimation and its associated circuitry are avoided. We derive an energy detection metric for a multi-antenna receiver based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion. By considering a biased pulse amplitude modulation, we develop an analytical framework for the SM symbol error rate at high signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical results show that the diversity order is proportional to half the number of receive antennas; this result stems from having partial receiver channel knowledge. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with that of the coherent ML receiver and show that the SM energy detector outperforms its coherent counterpart in certain scenarios, particularly when utilizing non-negative constellations. Ultimately, we implement an SM testbed using software-defined radio devices and provide experimental error rate measurements that validate our theoretical contribution.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2023.3314870","European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:819819); European Regional Development Fund and the Republic of Cyprus through the Research and Innovation Foundation(grant numbers:CONCEPT/0722/0123 (FLOAT)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10250901","Spatial modulation;energy detection;biased pulse-amplitude modulation;diversity;software-defined radio;experimental results","Symbols;Modulation;Receiving antennas;Detectors;Transmitting antennas;Error analysis;Complexity theory","","","","39","IEEE","13 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a novel technique, In-Vivo Clone Detection, that detects functional clones in arbitrary programs by identifying and mining their inputs and outputs. The key insight is to use existing workloads to execute programs and then measure functional similarities between programs based on their inputs and outputs, which mitigates the problems in object oriented languages reported by prior work.

On the other hand, producing a proper corpus that can be used for training a model for finding semantic similarities, is of great importance. In this study, the main purpose is to propose a method for measuring the semantic similarity between short Persian texts. To do so, first, we try to build an appropriate corpus, and then propose an efficient approach based on neural networks. The proposed method involves three steps. The first step is data collection and building a parallel corpus. In the next step, namely the pre-processing step, the data is normalized. Finally, Semantic similarity recognition is done by the neural network using vector representations of the words. The suggested model is built upon the produced corpus made of movie and tv show subtitles containing 35266 sentence pairs.

Employing attention mechanisms to extract part features has become a trend. However, there are two major limitations in these methods: First, they often focus on the most salient part while neglecting other inconspicuous but distinguishable parts. Second, they treat different part features in isolation while neglecting their relationships. To handle these limitations, we propose to locate multiple different distinguishable parts and explore their relationships in an explicit way. In this pursuit, we introduce two lightweight modules that can be easily plugged into existing convolutional neural networks. On one hand, we introduce a feature boosting and suppression module that boosts the most salient part of feature maps to obtain a part-specific representation and suppresses it to force the following network to mine other potential parts. On the other hand, we introduce a feature diversification module that learns semantically complementary information from the correlated part-specific representations.

In this work, we tackled the decision-making process related to diversion scenarios. Diversion is a deviation or alternative from the original flight plan, usually due to some problem caused in the aircraft, such as leakage of fuel, of engine and in aerodynamic surfaces, among other problems of the aircraft that can make it impossible to arrive at the previously defined destination airport. We propose a case-based reasoning (CBR) model for aiding the pilot to deal with diversion situations, chosen as adequate scenarios from the results of a survey conducted with pilots to identify those for which an AI-based approach might be helpful regarding decision making. A CBR system basically uses a memory of recorded cases for generating new solutions to similar problems, it thus contains a ""memory"" of cases with descriptions of specific situations that occurred in the past, solutions of these described situations, and the evaluation of their results. The reasoner solves new problems by adapting in-memory solutions to it, via some similarity criteria. Specific similarity measures for comparing cases and retrieving the ones most similar to the diversion situation at hand were defined, and a database for 26 diversion cases was built for conducting the experiments on decision making. Case retrieval experiments over 20 diversion test situations produced a success rate (that is, a diversion suggestion compatible with pilot decisions) of 85%. We intend to perform as future work an extension of the cases database by incorporating real diversion situations, dynamic attributes related to weather and traffic intensity at the diversion airport, and a more comprehensive assessment by pilots, possibly towards a learnable automatic weight adjustment for the attributes that compose the case similarity metric.","2155-7209","979-8-3503-3357-2","10.1109/DASC58513.2023.10311203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10311203","Decision-Making;Diversion;Artificial Intelligence;Case-Based Reasoning","Surveys;Databases;Atmospheric modeling;Decision making;Airports;Aerodynamics;Cognition","","","","13","IEEE","10 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, the diversification mechanism is mostly realized by perturbing the incumbent solutions to escape from local optima. In this paper, we report our attempt toward providing a new diversification mechanism, which is based on the concept of instance perturbation. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed mechanism achieves the diversification by perturbing the instance under solving, rather than the solutions. To tackle the challenge of incorporating instance perturbation into hyper-heuristics, we also design a new hyper-heuristic framework HIP-HOP (recursive acronym of HIP-HOP is an instance perturbation-based hyper-heuristic optimization procedure), which employs a grammar guided high level strategy to manipulate the low level heuristics.

To alleviate the reliance on human intervention, this article presents a novel framework that integrates active learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to effectively exploit small human-labeled data for terrain mapping. In order to model the diverse terrain patterns, this article designs two novel diversity-sensitive GAN models which can capture fine-grained terrain classes among aerial image patches. The proposed approaches are tested in two real-world scenarios using our collaborative air–ground robotic platform. The empirical results show that our methods can outperform their counterparts in the predictive accuracy of terrain classification, visual quality of terrain mapping, and average length of the planned ground path. In practice, the proposed terrain mapping framework is especially valuable when the budget in time or labor cost is very limited.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2962086","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1713212,61572330,61836005,61702341); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province-Outstanding Youth Program(grant numbers:2019B151502018); Technology Research Project of Shenzhen City(grant numbers:JSGG20180507182904693); Public Technology Platform of Shenzhen City(grant numbers:GGFW2018021118145859); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972606","Active learning (AL);generative adversarial network (GAN);multiagent system","Multi-agent systems;Generative adversarial networks;Data models;Training data;Robots;Terrain mapping;Collaboration","Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Robotics","8","","56","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, various adaptive and intelligent traffic light control approaches have been adopted in many cities, resulting in the development of current GLOSA technologies lagging behind that of traffic light technologies. When taking diverse dynamic traffic lights into account, it is difficult to model the interactions between vehicles and traffic lights, which is further exacerbated by the hybrid control strategies of traffic lights. To this end, we design a new GLOSA system SpeedAdv to provide optimal speed advisory for addressing diverse traffic lights. We formulate the problem as a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MAMDP) with an implicit common goal and propose a heterogeneous-agent collaborative framework based on reinforcement learning. Three main modules are used in the system: i) a spatio-temporal relation reasoning module based on the phase-aware attention mechanism pays more attention to the traffic rules and traffic flow diversion of adjacent intersections to predict traffic conditions for a few seconds later; ii) a behavior approximating module based on imitation learning is introduced to approximate the phases of diverse traffic lights; iii) a speed advisory module provides the optimal speed advisory based on policy gradient reinforcement learning relying on the above two modules and other information collected by vehicles. We implement and evaluate SpeedAdv with a real-world trajectory dataset, together with a field test based on a prototype system, demonstrating that SpeedAdv improves the overall performance by at least 24.1% in terms of travel time, energy consumption, safety, and comfort compared to the state-of-the-art GreenDrive method.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2023.3319697","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62222202,62232004,61972044); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921003); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B18008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265152","Cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system;GLOSA;deep reinforcement learning;heterogeneous agents","Reinforcement learning;Green products;Vehicle dynamics;Uncertainty;Safety;Urban areas;Trajectory","","1","","61","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results of two hundreds of simulation tests show that the same continuous handover sequence probability is higher in the suburban simulation experiment scene than in urban one possibly because the larger cell radius in suburban areas covers more roads.

Two algorithms are then proposed to recognize similar reviews and relevant reviews from all reviews. Compared to the traditional algorithm, our review identification algorithm achieves shorter execution time. More importantly, the proposed algorithm for recognizing relevant reviews can be used to analyze the relevancy between the review content and the given review topic by using the automatic word segmentation technique. The Experimental results show that the number of fake reviews by our algorithms is higher than that of the traditional algorithm.

Enclosing the system in a carry-on Pelican Case, the Microwave Radar-in-a-Briefcase (MicRIB) is a portable, low-cost test bench. The MicRIB is capable of arbitrary waveform transmission, data capture, and range-Doppler filtering in real-time while I/Q sampling at 61.4 MHz.

Importantly, here “real-time” indicates that radar processing can be performed indefinitely without compounding latency. The MicRIB performance is experimentally evaluated in an open-air setting, performing moving target indication (MTI) processing (except for clutter cancellation). To demonstrate system flexibility, waveforms including linear FM, nonlinear FM, and random FM are assessed. Pulse compression is performed with either a matched filter or least squares mismatched filter, and a slow time Taylor window is applied prior to Doppler processing.

This motivates us to propose a novel Two-stream Prototype Learning Network (TSPLN) for FSFR under occlusions by simultaneously considering the quality of support images and their relevance to the query image. Specifically, we design a two-stream architecture, which mainly consists of a support-centered stream and query-centered stream, to learn the optimal class prototypes. The former stream is to reduce the negative impact of occluded images on the prototype. This is achieved by exploring the similarities between different images in the support set. In the query-centered stream, we exploit the relevance between the query and support set based on feature alignment (FA).

The MIMO-diversity technique detects and computes the transmitted signal power during reception and conditionally informs the transmitter to switch between Type (1) and Type (2) transmission. Two experimental models have been tested to show the feasibility of such a technique. In the first model, we constructed a full transceiver and uses a switch IC to switch between MIMO and diversity. The second model uses a microcontroller and software decision to switch between two COM ports, each of them dedicated to MIMO and diversity output respectively. Results suggest that shadowing and alignment problems commonly encountered in visible-light communication systems can be readily solved using these methods.

As a result, a signature model composed of a set of interval values (corresponding to the number of features) is obtained for each individual's handwritten signature class. A novel fuzzy similarity measure is further proposed to compute the similarity between a test sample signature and the corresponding interval-valued symbolic model for the verification of the test sample. To evaluate the proposed verification approach, a benchmark offline English signature data set (GPDS-300) and a large data set (BHSig260) composed of Bangla and Hindi offline signatures were used.

Their penetration in our daily life increases the need for their enhanced resilience and for means to secure and protect them. One major threat is the software monoculture. Latest research work illustrated the danger of software monoculture and introduced diversity to reduce the attack surface. In this paper, we propose a biologically-inspired defense system, ChameleonSoft, that employs multidimensional software diversity to, in effect, induce spatiotemporal software behavior encryption and a moving target defense. The key principles are decoupling functional roles and runtime role players; devising intrinsically-resilient composable online programmable building blocks; separating logic, state and physical resources; and employing functionally-equivalent, behaviorally-different code variants. Given, our construction, ChameleonSoft is also equipped with an autonomic failure recovery mechanism for enhanced resilience. Nodes employing ChameleonSoft autonomously and cooperatively change their recovery and encryption policy both proactively and reactively according to the continual change in context and environment. In order to test the applicability of the proposed approach, we present a prototype of the ChameleonSoft Behavior Encryption (CBE) and recovery mechanisms. Further, using analysis and simulation, we study the performance and security aspects of the proposed system. This study aims to evaluate the provisioned level of security by measuring the level of induced confusion and diffusion to quantify the strength of the CBE mechanism. Further, we compute the computational cost of security provisioning and enhancing system resilience. A brief attack scenario is also included to illustrate the complexity of attacking ChameleonSoft.","","978-1-936968-36-7","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2011.247115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144809","Cyber security;Ubiquitous computing;Software diversity;Online programmability;Biologically-inspired security","Runtime;Monitoring;Software;Virtual machining;Organisms","","12","2","24","","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing plagiarism detectors are either applied to a programming language or a pre-defined set of programming languages. The general purpose one usually employs string matching to perform similarity measures that are based on plagiarism detection among documents in general, and not in programs in particular, thus, losing much of the structure and logic of programs in the process. On the other hand, plagiarism detectors for specific languages only cater to that particular set of languages. This study provides a means for the user to specify the programming language of the student programs to be analyzed. Moreover, an automatic plagiarism detector system must be immune to the transformations that students perform on copied programs. These transformations are usually dependent on several factors namely: the type of programming problems and correspondingly, the complexity of the project to be implemented by the students, and also the programming language paradigm of the programs. Thus, the similarity measures employed by the system should be determined by these factors and can be specified by the professor. He/she has the option to specify how the similarities among the student programs will be captured. The system provides an interface for the specification of the particular programming language in which the student programs are implemented, and a knowledgebase of similarity measures that the user would like to include in the analysis of the student programs. Hence, the system provides flexibility in the programming language of the student programs to be analyzed and the similarity measures that the professor wishes to employ. Initial qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate a flexible, convenient and cost-effective tool for building plagiarism detectors for effective detection of programs in various imperative and procedural programming languages. The approach also addresses some of the changes that students perform on copied programs which JPlag fails to handle, thus, allowing for improved accuracy in terms of the reduction of false-positives, increasing the chance of catching plagiarized programs. These changes include modification of control structures, use of temporary variables and subexpressions, in-lining and re-factoring of methods, and redundancy (variables or methods that were not used). Comprehensive tests on other programming languages under various programming language paradigms such as object-oriented, logic and functional languages, considering the different changes that the students employ to copied programs (such as the tests done in JPlag) are also recommended for empirical evaluation","","1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141631","Plagiarism detection;transformations;similarity measures","Plagiarism;Computer languages;Detectors;Computer science;Logic testing;Particle measurements;Logic programming;Performance evaluation;Area measurement;Education","","3","","16","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they are not scalable for very large data due to their non-linear complexity. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to reduce the complexity of Hierarchical Clustering, improve the purity of the clustering algorithm, and reduce the chaining factor. The proposed method has the following components: (i) A new combination similarity based on common-neighbours of graph theory is proposed, (ii) In every iteration, instead of calculating the centroids for new clusters, new centroids are estimated from centroids in previous iteration, and (iii) In each iteration, instead of merging only one pair of objects, multiple pairs are merged at the same time. In addition to the proposed combination similarity, four well-known methods including centroid-based, group-based, complete-link, and single-link, have been also implemented. All five methods are tested and evaluated using two metrics: purity and imbalance or chaining factor.

Thus, companies try to enhance their digital creativities to more firmly establish their competitiveness in the marketplace. The purpose of this research is to longitudinally explore the evolutionary pattern of digital creativity in order to explain how communication effectiveness, task expertise, and the tendencies of digitalists affect digital creativity. To add more rigor to the proposed research model, task diversity is included as a moderating factor. To test the validity of the proposed digital creativity model over time, we adopted multi-agent simulation (MAS) using the NetLogo platform to test the digital creativity model over 48 time lags. The experimental results revealed that the proposed digital creativity model is valid and robust enough to explain the creative activities of digitalists.","","978-1-4244-6581-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2011.5998140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5998140","","Communication effectiveness;Cultural differences;Companies;Presses;Complexity theory;Multiagent systems","","","","26","IEEE","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, at the same time that brings more disadvantages to users such as the probability of user information leakage is higher. Among any other threats, Android application cloning has brought tremendous risks to the market environment. It is not always feasible to distinguish the applications by comparing application release dates or file sizes. In this paper, we perform a systematic analysis in Android applications. We test the difference of obfuscated and not obfuscated applications by Androguard to verify its resistance against Proguard at first. Then explain that modified applications may bring some disadvantages to unsuspecting users by smali instrumentation. We compute the similarity value of modified and original apps with Androguard. Finally, we use a testing tool based Robotium to detect the details such as the UI of applications. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the system in similarity detection. And we present the application of image processing technology in the similarity detection.","","978-1-5090-5521-0","10.1109/ICSAI.2016.7811010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7811010","Android;Smali instrumentation;Clone analysis;Similarity","Androids;Humanoid robots;Smart phones;Cloning;Instruments;Feature extraction","","6","","29","IEEE","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both modifications of the method were tested according to the comprehensive testing recommendations of the international commission MPEG for the evaluation of complex video tools, on the example of 13 video sequences, with different bitrates. The effect of increasing the size of the blocks on which the image is divided on the PSNR value and the maximum acceleration was also investigated.","","978-1-6654-0682-6","10.1109/PICST54195.2021.9772109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9772109","artificial intelligence;video stream compression;motion vector;image similarity evaluation;edge selection;LoG;Canny;block search method","Measurement;Image coding;Uncertainty;Laplace equations;Search methods;Image edge detection;Video sequences","","","","13","IEEE","16 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
