"Digital microfluidic biochips: Functional diversity, More than Moore, and cyberphysical systems","K. Chakrabarty; P. Pop; T. -Y. Ho","Duke University, Durham, NC, USA; Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark; National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan",2011 Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE/ACM/IFIP International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS),"27 Oct 2011","2011","","","377","377","Summary form only given. The 2010 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicted that bio-medical chips will soon revolutionize the healthcare market. These bio-medical chips should be able to sense and actuate, store and manipulate data, and transmit information. To realize such bio-medical chips, the integration of embedded systems and microfluidics inevitably leads to a new research dimension for More than Moore and beyond. This tutorial will introduce attendees to the emerging technology of digital microfluidics, which is poised to play a key role in the transformation of healthcare and the interplay between biochemistry and embedded systems. Advances in droplet-based “digital” microfluidics have led to the emergence of biochip devices for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of nanoliter-volume droplets of biochemical samples and reagents. Therefore, integrated circuit (IC) technology can be used to transport and transport “chemical payload” in the form of micro/nanofluidic droplets. As a result, non-traditional biomedical applications and markets (e.g., high-throughout DNA sequencing, portable and point-of-care clinical diagnostics, protein crystallization for drug discovery), and fundamentally new uses are opening up for ICs and systems. However, continued growth (and larger revenues resulting from technology adoption by pharmaceutical and healthcare companies) depends on advances in chip integration and design-automation tools. In particular, design-automation tools are needed to ensure that biochips are as versatile as the macro-labs that they are intended to replace. This is therefore an opportune time for the semiconductor industry and circuit/system designers to make an impact in this emerging field. This tutorial offers attendees an opportunity to bridge the semiconductor ICs/systems industry with the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. The audience will see how a “biochip compiler” can translate protocol descriptions provided by an end user (e.g., a chemist or a nurse at a doctor's clinic) to a set of optimized and executable fluidic instructions that will run on the underlying digital microfluidic platform. Testing techniques will be described to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. Sensor integration and close coupling between the underlying hardware and the control software in a cyberphysical framework will also be described. A number of case studies based on representative assays and laboratory procedures will be interspersed in appropriate places throughout the tutorial. Commercial devices and advanced prototypes from the major company in this market segment (Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc.) will be described, and ongoing activity on newborn screening using digital microfluidic biochips at several large hospitals in Illinois will be highlighted. The topics covered in the tutorial include the following: 1) Technology and application drivers: Motivation and background, actuation methods, electrowetting and digital microfluidics, review of micro-fabrication processes, applications to biochemistry, medicine, and laboratory procedures. 2) System-level design automation: Synthesis techniques: scheduling of fluidic operations, resource binding (mapping of operations to on-chip resources), module placement. 3) Physical-level design automation: droplet routing, defect tolerance, chip-level design, and design of pin-constrained biochips. 4) Testing and design-for-testability: Defects, fault modeling, test planning, reconfiguration techniques, sensor integration and cyberphysical system design.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","10.1145/2039370.2039430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062311","Microfluidics;biochips;system-on-chip;design automation","Microfluidics;Medical services;Tutorials;Laboratories;Integrated circuits;Educational institutions;Biochemistry","","1","","","","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finally ReLog selects the item with the highest similarity and meets the minimum threshold as the matching item, so as to identify the log. In order to verify the effectiveness of ReLog, we tested it on datasets of 15 types of logs including Hadoop, Spark, and Mac.

To overcome these problems, we propose a safe diversity approach that preserves the timing properties of real-time processes by controlling its impact on the worst case execution time (WCET).

A computerized system is considered capable of quickly finding similarities in writing articles or scientific works that lead to plagiarism. In this study, detection of similarity in the document that leads to plagiarism is carried out by building an inverted index for each sentence in document in the database by performing data preprocessing then testing one by one for each sentence in the test document using the VSM method with term-frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF). The results obtained are that VSM with TF-IDF weighting can calculate sentence similarity with a high similarity value of 1 (100%). However, VSM with this weighting does not consider the word's position, then using the proposal of a 1-gram word weighting technique with a comparison process from left-to-right (left-to-right) and right-to-left (right-to-left) between database sentences and sentences.

Traditional methods solving MOPs are robust and have proven their effectiveness in handling many classes of optimization problems. However, such techniques can encounter difficulties such as getting trapped in local minima, increasing computational complexity, and not being applicable to certain classes of objective functions. Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) can overcome these disadvantages and have shown great potentials to solve MOPs.

By definition, because of the narrow applicability of specialization, broad supercomputing adoption requires using different heterogeneous components, each optimized for a specific application domain. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the introduced heterogeneity of specialization across the HPC stack: interconnects including memory models, accelerators including power and cooling, use cases and applications including AI, and delivery models, such as traditional, as-a-Service, and federated.

In addition, minor genres are often inhibited due to their minute share of the whole similarity. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines the advantages of item-item similarity and user-user similarity by introducing a genre component to the relation between user and item. In our approach, the direct user-item relevance is developed into the combination of genre similarity and preference similarity, thus capturing more accurately the relevance between items as well as between user and item.

Various kinds of research have been conducted on similarity retrievals of 3D models since the late 1990's. Although most of the retrieval techniques focus on shape similarity of the 3D models, our technique allows users to retrieve and classify 3D models based on texture pattern similarity. To test our texture similarity retrieval technique, a set of a textured 3D model database was synthesized from 3D polygonal models and 2D texture images. The database was analyzed by software programs, and texture features were extracted from each 3D model. The extracted texture features were computed based on HLAC (higher order local autocorrelation) and fractal dimensions. Often, both kinds of texture features were used for analyzing 2D texture images. However, we extended the techniques to handle three dimensional volumetric data for extracting features from textured 3D models. Our experimental web-based retrieval system successfully retrieved textured 3D models with fairly acceptable recall-precision rates. This retrieval technique which is based on texture patterns can be used in conjunction with traditional shape similarity retrieval techniques, and the technique can enhance similarity retrieval performances.","","978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466933","Solid texture;Similarity Retrieval;Shape feature;3D Model;Multimedia database","Feature extraction;Data mining;Shape;Image databases;Spatial databases;Image texture analysis;Testing;Information retrieval;Image retrieval;Data analysis","","2","1","18","IEEE","20 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of design diversity depends on the assumption that functionally equivalent services, i.e., variant services, rarely fail on the same input case. However, there are no directives to assess whether variant services are actually diverse and fail on disjoint subsets of the input space. Aim: To provide proper assessment of service diversity in order to achieve a high level of reliability by employing either a diversity-based solution with the variant services or a single service that exhibits higher reliability than would be the case if design diversity was adopted. Method: We propose an experimental setup that encompasses (i) a set of directives to organize the preparation and execution of the experiment to investigate service diversity; (ii) investigation of whether variant services are actually diverse by using statistical tests; and (iii) an analysis of if and by how much the reliability of a diversity-based solution that leverages voters is an improvement over one that uses a single service. We evaluated the applicability and usefulness of the proposed experimental setup by employing it to assess diversity of variant services adhering to four different requirements specifications. For each specification, we analysed three different services. Results: We found that the proposed directives were effective for the purposes of this assessment. Assessment results demonstrated that services implementing the four requirements specifications are actually diverse at a 0.05 significance level. For two of the specifications, coincident failures of two or more services are infrequent enough to promote gains in overall system reliability.

Face recognition application in computer system have been developed in recent year including surveillance, human-computer interaction, and multimedia application. Some challenges will possibly be undergone in face recognition research mostly lie on deformation of face condition such as pose, expression, illumination, and accessories use that lead to a noticeable impact on recognition rate. In this research, two-dimensional Gabor wavelet filter bank was implemented to extract face image. Gabor filter has characteristic similar to wavelet that is localized in both time and frequency domain able to extract local feature on face image. Convolution process produces a face representation feature called Gaborface in a terms of magnitude information obtained from sinusoidal complex function. Features are formed as a column matrix concatenation which is called feature vector. At the end of process, one distance-based similarity measure, i.e., Euclidean Distance was implemented to perform a test measurement on data features vector with database features. Testing has been done by giving variation in some aspects, i.e., number of training data, face image deformation such pose and expression, and the variant of filter with variation in scale and orientation. The best system, based on this research, is achieved by $5 \times 8$ filter bank with accuracy up to 98,67%. The proposed method also shows a very well performance in recognizing the expression changes, but it cannot accommodate properly in pose changes.","","979-8-3503-4571-1","10.1109/ICIC56845.2022.10007016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10007016","Face Recognition;Computer Vision;2-D Gabor Wavelet Filter Bank;distance-based similarity measure;Euclidean Distance","Wavelet domain;Face recognition;Filter banks;Training data;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Gabor filters","","1","","15","IEEE","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then it is showed that the precision of algorithms that only take into account the functional properties of services for measuring their similarity are low. Therefore the textual descriptions of Web services are also taken into account and the textual similarity of services is also calculated.

We analyze the effects of two main approaches that aim at a restriction of the necessary efforts: the direct use of OCR-processed documents instead of manually post-processed, i.e. corrected documents; and the use of shorter excerpts of documents instead of complete documents. For our tests, similarity links were computed based on the vector-space model; the links that are generated based on unmodified OCR documents and excerpts of documents are then compared to those links that are generated based on complete documents without OCR errors.","","0-8186-8147-0","10.1109/DEXA.1997.617294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=617294","","Joining processes;Software libraries;Optical character recognition software;Information retrieval;Database languages;Navigation;Testing","","","4","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a similarity matching algorithm for assessing the reliability of software after patch application. Our methodology makes use of a backup control center in order to test the patched software. By running the test on input from field remote terminal units streamed from the same input source as that presented to the main control system, our algorithm is able to examine the degree of similarity of logged outputs, and highlight possible departures from expected behaviour. A metric called the fidelity score for the degree of similarity is presented along with initial results from a laboratory testbed. Initial results show that when patches are acceptable the algorithm consistently produces fidelity scores above 95%.","2472-8152","978-1-6654-3775-2","10.1109/ISGT50606.2022.9817486","Energy Market Authority of Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817486","SCADA;EMS/DMS;syslog;server patching","Measurement;Substations;Operating systems;Software algorithms;Control systems;Software;Software reliability","","","","16","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The board-level drop test, based on the JEDEC standard, is widely employed by researchers to assess the impact performance of electronic packages. Typically, these tests are conducted with boards placed horizontally. However, real-world service environments involve impacts at various angles that can lead to different failure mechanisms in solder joints. In this study, we investigate the impact reliability of microbump interconnect structures under different impact angles. By considering plastic strain analysis, we demonstrate that drop impacts at other angles can be equivalently represented by the scenario with drop angle  $\alpha =$  0° impact. Subsequently, we analyze the failure mechanism of microbumps during drop tests and propose a predictive model for their drop life under varying impact angles. Our results indicate that as the drop angle increases, there is a transition in the driving force for microbump failures from tensile and compressive stress to shear stress. The proposed life prediction model exhibits an error rate below 25% and effectively forecasts the drop life of microbumps in advanced packaging.","1558-2574","","10.1109/TDMR.2024.3370631","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2022YFB3306103); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52227806,U20A6004); State Key Laboratory of Precision Manufacturing for Extreme Service Performance(grant numbers:ZZYJKT2023-07); Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:CJGJZD20220517141804010); Central South University Graduate Students Independent Exploration and Innovation Project(grant numbers:1053320230645); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10445702","Microbumps;board-level drop reliability;impact angle;failure mechanism;life prediction model","Strain;Soldering;Predictive models;Load modeling;Substrates;Strain measurement;Failure analysis","","1","","23","IEEE","27 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method analyzed the behavior of malware by application program interface (API) association and constructed NCSG. The graph could reflect the command-and-control(C&C) logic of malware. Therefore, it can resist the interference of code obfuscation technology. The structural features extracted from NCSG will be used as the basis of similarity analysis for training the detection model. Finally, we tested the dataset constructed from five known malware family samples, and the experimental results showed that the accuracy of this method for malware variation analysis reached 92.75%.

Existing works usually assume that the query function and target function share equal semantics and compare their full semantics to obtain the similarity. However, we find that the function mapping is more complex, especially when function inlining happens. In this paper, we will systematically investigate cross-inlining binary function similarity detection. We first construct a cross-inlining dataset by compiling 51 projects using 9 compilers, with 4 optimizations, to 6 architectures, with 2 inlining flags, which results in two datasets both with 216 combinations. Then we construct the cross-inlining function mappings by linking the common source functions in these two datasets. Through analysis of this dataset, we find that three cross-inlining patterns widely exist while existing work suffers when detecting cross-inlining binary function simi-larity. Next, we propose a pattern-based model named CI-Detector for cross-inlining matching. CI-Detector uses the attributed CFG to represent the semantics of binary functions and GNN to embed bi-nary functions into vectors. CI-Detector respectively trains a model for these three cross-inlining patterns. Finally, the testing pairs are input to these three models and all the produced similarities are aggregated to produce the final similarity. We conduct several experiments to evaluate CI-Detector. Results show that CI-Detector can detect cross-inlining pairs with a precision of 81% and a recall of 97%, which exceeds all state-of-the-art works.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10549732","Cross-Inlining;Binary Similarity Detection;Inlining Pattern","Semantics;Vectors;Security;Pattern matching;Optimization;Testing;Software engineering","","","","84","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent proliferation of IoT devices has also increased the demand for similarity detection across different architectures. However, there are currently not many examples of feature extraction methods using neural machine translation (NMT) models being applied to similarity detection in basic block units across different architectures. In this research, we propose new methods that extract features at a higher speed and detect similarities across different architectures with higher accuracy than existing methods for basic block feature extraction using neural machine translation models. We assume that the intermediate representation of the NMT model, which learned the translation of basic blocks across different architectures, includes the semantics of the instructions in the basic block. Hence we adopted the intermediate representation as the features of the basic blocks. Then, we applied the linear transformation used in bilingual word embedding to match the embedding space of basic blocks across different architectures. This enables the similarity detection in basic block units across different architectures with higher accuracy than the distance learning method used in existing research to match the embedding space. In the evaluation experiment, we compare the Precision at k (P@k) on the same dataset with existing research methods and our method achieved the highest accuracy of 92%. In addition, We also compare the time required for feature extraction using GPUs, and found that it was up to 16 times faster.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3316215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254199","Binary code similarity detection;machine learning;neural machine translation","Feature extraction;Binary codes;Semantics;Software engineering;Computer architecture;Training;Source coding;Machine learning;Neural networks;Machine translation","","","","38","CCBYNCND","18 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This suggests that inspection techniques may not be currently being deployed to their best effect in the context of large-scale OO systems. Work to date has revealed three significant issues that need to be addressed - the identification of chunks of code to be inspected, the order in which the code is read, and the resolution of frequent nonlocal references. Three techniques are developed with the aim of addressing these issues: one based on a checklist, one focused on constructing abstract specifications, and the last centered on the route that a use case takes through a system. The three approaches are evaluated empirically and, in this instance, it is suggested that the checklist is the most effective approach, but that the other techniques also have potential strengths.

"Measuring Class Cohesion Based on Client Similarities Between Method Pairs: An Improved Approach That Supports Refactoring","M. Alzahrani","Department of Computer Science, Albaha University, Albaha, Saudi Arabia",IEEE Access,"29 Dec 2020","2020","8","","227901","227914","Class cohesion is an important quality attribute that has an impact on other quality attributes such understandability, testability, and maintainability. Therefore, classes with low cohesion should be refactored in order to improve their overall qualities. Many cohesion metrics have been introduced in the literature to automatically assess the quality of the class and support refactoring activities. Most existing metrics measure the class cohesion based on how the methods of a class are internally related to each other, while a few metrics measure the class cohesion based on how the methods are externally used by the clients of the class. Unfortunately, the existing client-based cohesion metrics cannot automatically support refactoring techniques such as the Extract Class refactoring. Therefore, this article proposes a new client-based cohesion metric that can be used to automatically identify Extract Class refactoring opportunities. The proposed metric is theoretically evaluated by proving the compliance of the metric to the mathematical cohesion properties, while it is empirically evaluated by conducting a large case study on three systems to compare the metric with other cohesion metrics. Finally, the paper introduces and evaluates an Extract Class refactoring approach based the proposed cohesion metric.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300041","Software engineering;software measurement;cohesion metrics;code refactoring","Measurement;Volume measurement;Data mining;Coherence;Automation;Time measurement","","2","","41","CCBY","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A real example is the plagiarism of assignments during the lecture process. One of the efforts to prevent plagiarism is to use a system that has been developed in recent years. However, the price of subscribing to the system for a period is quite high. Therefore, we need a plagiarism detection system that everyone can access for free. In developing the system, of course, modeling must be done. Two popular algorithms are often used to detect word similarity: Rabin-Karp and Winnowing. In this study, a performance comparison was made between Rabin-Karp and Winnowing. Comparisons were made using the same dataset of 30 abstraction data from scientific publications. Based on the research, the performance of the Rabin-Karp algorithm and the Winnowing algorithm is almost as good. However, based on the two evaluation parameters used by the Winnowing algorithm, it produces more similarity scores than Rabin-Karp. The same thing also applies to the evaluation of processing time. Winnowing is slightly longer than Rabin-Karp. With the results of this comparison, it can be concluded that if you want a model sensitive to similarity, then Winnowing is recommended. However, if processing time is the target, it is recommended to use Rabin-Karp. In future research, tuning the parameter values of k or n in the Rabin-Karp and Winnowing algorithms is recommended. In addition, it is also recommended to experiment with another distance scoring.","","978-1-6654-7327-9","10.1109/ICIMCIS56303.2022.10017488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017488","Text Similarity;Winnowing;Rabin-Karp;Jaccard Coefficient;Cosine Similarity","Plagiarism;Multimedia systems;Informatics;Tuning;Testing","","1","","28","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches typically have restricted usages due to their assumptions on the availability of an oracle, comparable implementation, or manual inspection efforts. We solve this problem by proposing a novel program synthesis based approach, SynEva, that can systematically construct an oracle-alike mirror program for similarity measurement, and automatically compare it with the existing knowledge on new scenarios to decide how the knowledge suits the new scenarios. SynEva is lightweight and fully automated. Our experimental evaluation with real-world data sets validates SynEva's effectiveness by strong correlation and little overhead results.

To tolerate faults, both of these techniques rely on design diversity, i.e. the availability of multiple implementations of a specification. Software engineers assume that the different implementations use different designs and, thereby, it is hoped, contain different faults. Our study uses a novel method of incorporating diversity in the development of one version of the software. We term this approach the pipeline method of software development. Its purpose is to eliminate as many software faults as possible before the testing phase. The method was applied to the specification of a real, automatic airplane-landing problem.

SSI is explored individually and in combination with other features extracted from both raw EEG signal and Wavelet Package Decomposition (WPD) coefficients. Several ML models are tested on the Bonn dataset to identify the most suitable model for classifying data into 3 classes - healthy, ictal, and inter-ictal. We show that the proposed SSI is superior to other features when used in a single-feature Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and yields 81.80% accuracy. This result is further improved to 99.00% when SSI is combined with 24 other commonly extracted features.

With the path towards Exascale, new HPC runtime systems are also emerging in a way that differs from classical distributed computing models. However, system software for such capabilities on the latest extreme-scale DOE supercomputing needs to be enhanced to more appropriately support these types of emerging software ecosystems. In this paper, we propose the use of Virtual Clusters on advanced supercomputing resources to enable systems to support not only HPC workloads, but also emerging big data stacks. Specifically, we have deployed the KVM hypervisor within Cray's Compute Node Linux on a XC-series supercomputer testbed. We also use libvirt and QEMU to manage and provision VMs directly on compute nodes, leveraging Ethernet-over-Aries network emulation. To our knowledge, this is the first known use of KVM on a true MPP supercomputer. We investigate the overhead our solution using HPC benchmarks, both evaluating single-node performance as well as weak scaling of a 32-node virtual cluster. Overall, we find single node performance of our solution using KVM on a Cray is very efficient with near-native performance. However overhead increases by up to 20% as virtual cluster size increases, due to limitations of the Ethernet-over-Aries bridged network. Furthermore, we deploy Apache Spark with large data analysis workloads in a Virtual Cluster, effectively demonstrating how diverse software ecosystems can be supported by High Performance Virtual Clusters.","2168-9253","978-1-5386-2326-8","10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048942","hpc;kvm;vm;virtual machines;virtual clusters;virtualization;supercomputer;cray;hpcg;spark;apache","Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization;Hardware;Big Data;Cloud computing;Computational modeling","","2","","49","IEEE","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for several applications, including matching of voice, audio and medical signals (e.g., electrocardiograms), one is required to permit local accelerations and decelerations in the rate of sequences, leading to a popular, field tested dissimilarity metric called the ""time warping"" distance. From the indexing viewpoint, this metric presents two major challenges: (a) it does not lead to any natural indexable ""features"", and (b) comparing two sequences requires time quadratic in the sequence length. To address each problem, we propose to use: (a) a modification of the so called ""FastMap"", to map sequences into points, with little compromise of ""recall"" (typically zero); and (b) a fast linear test, to help us discard quickly many of the false alarms that FastMap will typically introduce. Using both ideas in cascade, our proposed method achieved up to an order of magnitude speed-up over sequential scanning on both real and synthetic datasets.","1063-6382","0-8186-8289-2","10.1109/ICDE.1998.655778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=655778","","Databases;Indexing;Pattern matching;Speech recognition;Discrete Fourier transforms;Computer science;Educational institutions;Application software;Acceleration;Testing","","164","3","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, focusing on traffic sign recognition tasks, we empirically analyze the impact of diversity parameter estimations for predicting the reliability of three-version traffic sign classifier systems. Using five real-world traffic sign datasets, we confirm that the three-version architecture effectively enhances system reliability by applying diverse models and diversified input images. Then, we estimate the diversity parameters and apply them to variants of reliability prediction models. The prediction residuals between the observed reliability and the predicted reliability are mostly less than 0.017 across all data sets, which is half of the residual achieved by the conventional prediction model, except for the architecture of a single model with triple input. As the estimated values of diversity parameters tend to be stable with a relatively small number of samples, we consider that the reliability prediction models using diversity parameters are useful in the early-stage design of ML systems.","2332-6549","979-8-3503-1594-3","10.1109/ISSRE59848.2023.00064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10301216","Classification;Diversity;Machine learning system;N-version programming;Reliability","Measurement;Maximum likelihood estimation;Parameter estimation;Systems architecture;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Reliability theory","","","","38","IEEE","2 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, most of the methods to solve the problem of multi-label emotion recognition focus on analyzing the semantics of the text, ignoring the semantic information brought by emotion tags, and not modeling the semantic relationship between emotion labels and text. In this paper, a method of multi-label emotion recognition based on label similarity attention mechanism is proposed. In this method, bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used to obtain the context knowledge of the text, so as to achieve the purpose of learning the global information of the text. The label features are learned by the label encoder. The label similarity attention mechanism is used to obtain the correlation matrix between the label and the word representation, and further strengthen the semantic information. At the same time, CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) is used to obtain local semantic information. The semantic representation of sentences is enriched. Finally, emotion recognition is carried out through the classifier. In the classifier, this paper proposes a joint loss function, which enables the model to learn the emotional characteristics of texts and labels at the same time. The model combines the global and local information of the text to show the semantic relationship between the text and the emotional label. The experimental results on the NLPCC2014Task1 dataset show that the proposed model has a certain performance improvement compared with the benchmark method.","","978-1-6654-7997-4","10.1109/IWECAI55315.2022.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750847","Multi-label classification;Sentiment classification;Attention mechanism","Emotion recognition;Analytical models;Correlation;Codes;Semantics;Blogs;Benchmark testing","","1","","12","IEEE","11 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To identify two words based on how they are pronounced require more efforts rather than simply testing character by character comparison. The solution to identify phonetic equality between two or more words is somehow tricky. Solution for this problem is achieved by applying a set of rules on the given word.

When two adjacent objective vectors are similar but the difference in the corresponding decision vectors is large, it is difficult to transfer from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. In this article, we argue that the key to overcoming this difficulty is the evaluation assignment for different subproblems based on local density and global utility. We propose a local-density measurement model to estimate the solution density around each subproblem. Based on the model, a local-diversity evaluation assignment strategy for the decomposition-based MOEA is designed to assign fitness evaluations among different subproblems. Two discrete MOPs are selected as test instances for experiments because they satisfy the premise that the difference in the corresponding decision vectors of adjacent objective vectors is large. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy enhances the population diversity. Besides, the combination of the proposed strategy and the evaluation assignment for high global utility subproblems can overcome the difficulty in transferring from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. The results also verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art evaluation assignment MOEAs regarding the inverted generational distance and the hypervolume metrics.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2022.3207457","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876207,62276103,61971052,61906069); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2214050004299); Guangdong Province Key Area Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018B010109003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020ZYGXZR014); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFC2004300,2020YFC2004302); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011700); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202002030355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906131","Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs);discrete multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs);local-density measurement;local-diversity evaluation assignment (LdEA)","Resource management;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Dynamic scheduling;Transforms;Stochastic processes","","2","","49","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing schemes for decomposition-based MOEAs fully rely on the relative improvement of the aggregated functions to do this. This paper proposes a diversity-enhanced RA strategy for this kind of MOEA, depending on both relative improvement on aggregated function value and solution density around each subproblem to assign computational resources. Thus, one subproblem surrounded with fewer solutions in its neighboring area and more relative improvement on the aggregated function value will be allocated a higher probability for evolution.

One of the features is an indoor navigation feature based on Augmented Reality (AR). However, the route from one point to another is not always straightforward. Therefore, this research will design and develop an application which aims to detect obstacles present in the route from starting point to ending point. Obstacles that can be detected in this application are 3D objects, classified as human, bag, chair, potted plant and table or desk. In the application, TensorFlow Lite is used to detect obstacles in the form of 3D objects, where the distance is calculated using a triangle similarity method. Once an object is identified, the application will provide sound/voice notification, vibration as well as augmented reality image on the screen to inform the user about the obstacle. This is done by having ARCore Software Development Kit. To evaluate the system, tests were carried out which included walking speed limit testing, and usability testing. In the walking speed limit test, the maximum speed when using the application is in the range of 1.27 m/s to 1.35 m/s.

Existing techniques detect ponzitracts by analyzing the code as well as a large amount of transaction data after time-consuming deployment. However, a conclusion based on transaction data can only be gotten after the damage has been caused. This paper proposes PonziDetector, a ponzitract detection technique that does not rely on transaction data. Behavior forest is introduced into PonziDetector to capture dynamic behaviors of smart contracts during interacting with them, which makes it possible to early detect ponzitracts. The empirical study demonstrates that PonziDetector, without transaction data, can improve the precision and the recall of the state-of-the-art to 94.6% and 93.0% respectively.

Image features are directly extracted instead of using OCR (optical character recognition). The proposed method forms so-called vertical bar patterns by detecting local extrema points in word units extracted by segmenting the document images. These vertical bar patterns form the feature vector of a document. The pair-wise similarity of document images is measured by calculating the scalar product of two document feature vectors. The proposed method is robust to changing fonts and styles, and is less affected by degradation of document qualities. To test the validity of the method, four corpora of document images were used and the ability of the method to retrieve relevant documents is reported.","","0-7695-1263-1","10.1109/ICDAR.2001.953868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953868","","Optical character recognition software;Shape;Image recognition;Text recognition;Feature extraction;Character recognition;Image segmentation;Robustness;Degradation;Testing","","","1","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically the best match (among a set of prestored objects) is assumed to be the correct match. This may work well in controlled environments (closed world). But, in uncontrolled environments (open world), the test object may not belong to the prestored object classes. In uncontrolled environments, a metric similarity measure (e.g. Euclidean) in conjunction with a threshold is used. However, based on psychophysical studies this is very different from, and far inferior to, human capabilities. To accept or reject a match, we introduce an approach that avoids metric similarity measures and the use of thresholds as it attempts to employ similarity measures used by humans. In the absence of sufficient real data, the approach allows to specifically generate an arbitrarily large number of training exemplars projecting near classification boundary. For aircraft detection, the performance of a neural network trained on such a training set, was comparable to that of a human expert, and far better than a network trained only on the available real data. Furthermore, the results were considerably better than those obtained using a Euclidean discriminator.","","0-7803-5467-2","10.1109/ICIP.1999.821690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821690","","Computer aided software engineering;Humans;Anthropometry;Object recognition;Testing;Military aircraft;Databases;Laboratories;Image recognition;Psychology","","","","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, it is shown that much better generalization can be obtained by using a variable interpolation kernel in combination with conjugate gradient optimization of the similarity metric and kernel size. The resulting method is called variable-kernel similarity metric (VSM) learning. It has been tested on a number of standard classification data sets, and on these problems it shows better generalization than backpropagation and most other learning methods. An important advantage is that the system can operate as a black box in which no model minimization parameters need to be experimentally set by the user. The number of parameters that must be determined through optimization are orders of magnitude less than for backpropagation or RBF networks, which may indicate that the method better captures the essential degrees of variation in learning.","","0-7803-1421-2","10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=713963","","Kernel;Learning systems;Interpolation;Neural networks;Testing;Optimization methods;Training data;Computer science;Application software;Radial basis function networks","","","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Harmonic coefficients generated by this mathematical theory are considered a robust source of information about 3D objects. In parallel, Ford-Fulkerson is a classical method in graph theory that solves network flows problems. In this work we demonstrate the potential of using SPHARMs along with the Ford-Fulkerson method, respectively as descriptor and similarity measure.

Our approach has been validated by a 3D medical dataset composed by 3D left ventricle surfaces, some of them presenting Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). The results indicated an average precision of 90%. In addition, the execution time was 65% lower than a descriptor previously tested.

First of all, a semantic tree is designed to define the range of the web service contents. Then, according to this semantic tree, we design a coding scheme for web service content following the principal of genetic variation. Finally, negative selection is imposed on the new content-data in the constraint of the similarity.

Therefore, flexible composition of Web services to fulfill the given challenging requirements is one of the most important objectives in this research field. However, until now, service composition has been largely an error-prone and tedious process. Furthermore, as the number of available web services increases, finding the right Web services to satisfy the given goal becomes intractable. In this paper, toward these issues, we propose an AI planning-based framework that enables the automatic composition of Web services, and explore the following issues. First, we formulate the Web-service composition problem in terms of AI planning and network optimization problems to investigate its complexity in detail. Second, we analyze publicly available Web service sets using network analysis techniques. Third, we develop a novel Web-service benchmark tool called WSBen. Fourth, we develop a novel AI planning-based heuristic Web-service composition algorithm named WSPR. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to verify WSPR against state-of-the-art AI planners.

Now a day's online tests and examinations are becoming popular to reduce the burden of the examination evaluation process. The online exams include either objective or multiple-choice questions. Nevertheless, the exams include only objective or multiple-choice questions. However, subjective-based questions and answers are not involved due to the evaluation process complexity and efficiency of the evaluation process. An automatic answer checker application that checks the written answers and marks the weightage similar to a human being is more helpful in the current modern era is necessary. Hence, the software applications built to check subjective answers may be more useful for allocating marks to the user after verifying the answers for online examination. This type of tool/application/system has the challenge of having an abundant resource database, including questions, corresponding answers, and the marks allocated to the corresponding answers. At the same time system need to verify the answers provided by the users by checking the template answers and the answers provided by the user. However, Artificial Intelligence is required to identify the core element of the answers while allocating marks. Hence, an Artificial Intelligence-based answer verifier is proposed to do the job of examiner/evaluator automatically.

Yet despite the criticality of automating GUI differencing, it is a manual, tedious, and laborious task. We offer a novel approach for differencing GUIs that combines tree edit distance measure algorithms with accessibility technologies for obtaining GUI models in a non-intrusive, platform and language-independent way, and it does not require the source code of GAPs. We developed a tool called GUI DifferEntiator (GUIDE) that allows users to difference GUIs of running GAPs. To evaluate GUIDE, we created an experimental platform that generates random GUIs with controlled differentials among them that serve as oracles. GUIDE enables researchers to plug-and-play various GUI differencing algorithms and to automatically run experiments. We evaluated GUIDE on 5,000 pairs of generated complex GUIs and three open-source GAPs and the results of our evaluation suggest that GUIDE can find differences between GUIs with a high degree of automation and precision.","","978-1-5386-7757-5","10.1109/QRS.2018.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424972","differencing, GUI, tree-edit, algorithms, accessibility, testing, similarity, generator, comparison","Graphical user interfaces;Testing;Task analysis;Microsoft Windows;Estimation;Computational modeling;Libraries","","3","1","61","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
