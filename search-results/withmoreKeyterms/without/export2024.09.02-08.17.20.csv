"Keynote speaker 1: Cyber-resilient ICS through diversified redundancy and intrusion detection","C. Kim",NA,2017 12th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST),"10 May 2018","2017","","","15","15","Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater interconnections of the control devices. The control devices are interconnected via modern control communication bus such as ModbusTCP which now leverages Ethernet to allow interoperability between different solutions and vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers. This presentation discusses diversified redundant architecture as a cyber-resilient system for networked control devices which maintains their normal operation even under compromised situations. This operation-based resilient architecture adds an isolated device, functionally equivalent to the networked primary device but with essential safe-mode operation features only, which is naturally immune to cyber incidents. In addition, a supervisor component monitors the operation of both networked and isolated devices, and transfers control to the safe-mode isolated device if the networked device operates abnormally, assuming that the abnormal operation is resulted from malicious hacking which has not been detected from the network cyber security defense. However, even with its resiliency, the diversified architecture has its own blind side — unawareness of presence of hacking traffic on the control bus when operational changes are not made by the hackers. Therefore, to solve this problem of unawareness of and undetected intrusion, we improve the architecture with an additional feature of intrusion detection utilizing open source software called Snort. The security features of Snort are incorporated as an intrusion detection and awareness solution, and are customized into the supervisor component of the diversified architecture for Modbus TCP/IP traffic monitoring. In laboratory tests, the added feature of intrusion detection has successfully initiated a safe-mode control transfer to the isolated device upon detection of unusual data traffic on the control bus. With this bus monitoring and intrusion detection, the diversified architecture would become a truly resilient and secure networked industrial control system.","","978-1-908320-93-3","10.23919/ICITST.2017.8356331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8356331","","Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Control systems;Computer crime;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits","","","","","","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs), the feasibility of solutions should be considered as well. Then the real challenge of constrained many-objective optimization can be generalized to the balance among convergence, diversity, and feasibility. In this paper, a tri-goal evolution framework is proposed for CMaOPs. The proposed framework carefully designs two indicators for convergence and diversity, respectively, and converts the constraints into the third indicator for feasibility. Since the essential goal of constrained many-objective optimization is to balance convergence, diversity, and feasibility, the philosophy of the proposed framework matches the essential goal of constrained many-objective optimization well. Thus, it is natural to use the proposed framework to deal with CMaOPs. Further, the proposed framework is conceptually simple and easy to instantiate for constrained many-objective optimization. A variety of balance schemes and ranking methods can be used to achieve the balance among convergence, diversity and feasibility. Three typical instantiations of the proposed framework are then designed. Experimental results on a constrained many-objective optimization test suite show that the proposed framework is highly competitive with existing state-of-the-art constrained many-objective evolutionary algorithms for CMaOPs.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2018.2858843","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673403,U1611262); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201608440449); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8432113","Constrained many-objective optimization;constraint handling;convergence;diversity;feasibility;tri-goal evolution (TiGE)","Convergence;Linear programming;Pareto optimization;Stochastic processes;Evolutionary computation;Computer science","","37","","56","IEEE","10 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A novel mechanism of similarity retrieval is proposed. Similarity measure between video sequences considering the spatio-temporal variation through consecutive frames is presented. For bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and the rich meaning that users desire to capture, video shots are analyzed and characterized by the high-level feature of motion activity in compressed domain. The extracted features of motion activity are further described by the 2D-histogram that is sensitive to the spatio-temporal variation of moving objects. In order to reduce the dimensions of feature vector space in sequence matching, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is exploited to map semantic features of consecutive frames to the frequency domain while retains the discriminatory information and preserves the Euclidean distance between feature vectors. Experiments are performed on MPEG-7 testing video streams, and the results of sequence matching show that a few DCT transformed coefficients are adequate and thus reveal the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism of video retrieval.","","0-7695-2031-6","10.1109/MMSE.2003.1254439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254439","","Object detection;Gunshot detection systems;Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Video sequences;Information retrieval;Spatial databases;Video compression;Motion analysis;Frequency domain analysis","","2","","13","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, existing middleware and tools provide little information to users as to the suitability of a given grid topology for a specific grid application. Instead, users generally use ad-hoc performance models to evaluate mappings of their applications to resource and network topologies. Grid application behavior alone is complex, and adding resource and network behavior makes the situation even worse. As a result, users typically employ nearly blind experimentation to find good deployments of their applications in each new grid environment. Only through actual deployment and execution can a user discovers if the mapping was a good one. Further, even after finding a good configuration, there is no basis to determine if a much better configuration has been missed. This approach slows effective grid application development and deployment. We present a richer methodology for evaluating grid software and diverse grid environments based on the MicroGrid grid online simulator. With the MicroGrid, users, grid researchers, or grid operators can define and simulate arbitrary collections of resources and networks. This allows study of an existing grid testbed under controlled conditions or even to study the efficacy of higher performance environments than are available today. Further, the MicroGrid supports direct execution of grid applications unchanged. These application can be written with MPI, C, C++, Perl, and/or Python and use the Globus middleware. This enables detailed and accurate study of application behavior. This work presents: (1) the first validation of the MicroGrid for studying whole-program performance of MPI grid applications and (2) a demonstration of the MicroGrid as a tool for predicting the performance of applications on a range of grid resources and novel network topologies.","","0-7695-2115-0","10.1109/CLADE.2004.1309092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309092","","Predictive models;Intelligent networks;Middleware;Application software;Network topology;Vehicle dynamics;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Computer science;Supercomputers","","4","1","32","IEEE","6 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article proposes an ultra-miniaturized implantable antenna featuring the smallest footprint with a volume of 0.7 mm3 and exhibits quad-band characteristics: telemetry at 915 MHz, wireless power transfer at midfield bands of 1450 and 1900 MHz, and control signaling at 2450 MHz. Extensive simulation analyses were conducted for the antenna alone and integrated antenna systems to realize the versatility of the proposed antenna. For validation, measurements were performed in saline-filled realistic head and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTMs) phantoms. Good agreement between the simulation and measured results was observed. The antenna showed stable performance in all scenarios with a measured −10 dB bandwidth of 136, 122, 108, and 134 MHz at 915, 1450, 1900, and 2450 MHz, respectively. Moreover, the antenna exhibited satisfactory measured gain values of −27.45, −23.25, −23.14, and −22.48 dBi at the respective frequency bands. Finally, the implementation of the wireless biotelemetry feature of the proposed antenna system was achieved and demonstrated through the utilization of a pair of software-defined radios (SDRs). Sustainable and stable wireless data transmission characteristics were shown at transmission distances of up to 2.5 m. With its remarkable features, the proposed antenna addresses the critical need for efficient communication in the Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) devices, enabling telemetry, wireless power transfer, and control signaling in biomedical applications with limited space and diverse frequency demands.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2024.3349782","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant; Korean Government Ministry of Science and ICT (MIST)(grant numbers:2022-0-00310); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388247","Implantable medical devices (IMDs);Internet of Medical Things (IoMT);midfield;miniaturization;specific absorption rate (SAR);wireless communication","Antennas;Antenna measurements;Performance evaluation;Wireless communication;Medical services;Biomedical measurement;Medical devices","","1","","37","IEEE","10 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"DeepEutaxy: Diversity in Weight Search Direction for Fixing Deep Learning Model Training Through Batch Prioritization","H. Zhang; W. K.

One of the critical issues is to conduct many trials and errors in developing a DL model that usually serves as the major component of such a system. A major reason for this inefficiency is the progress of gradual reduction of the gap between the DL model under training and the ground truths. Prior techniques commonly focus on optimizing such errors after the errors have formed. They are insensitive to how a training dataset is provided to the DL model under training in batches, making their approaches nonproactive to deal with such errors. In this article, we propose DeepEutaxy, the first work to repair the model convergence problem from the batch prioritization perspective. Our key insight is that increasing the diversity (i.e., dissimilarity) of the corresponding weights of complex DL models before and after each training step can make the models learn faster and optimize the training errors quicker. DeepEutaxy first trains a DL model with several epochs for initialization. It then partitions and continually prioritizes the training batches for subsequent training epochs based on our novel notion of diversity between the pair of models before and after training on each batch, capturing the strength of the search direction to deal with training errors impacted by that batch. The experiment on six DL models over the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets shows that DeepEutaxy can accelerate the convergence of DL models on these two datasets with speedups of 1.75-8.45 and 2.67-15.15 times with respect to the training and test accuracies, respectively. DeepEutaxy can also be integrated into the existing techniques and compare favorably with the prior art in the experiment.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2021.3086189","GRF of Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:11214116,11200015); HKSAR ITF(grant numbers:ITS/378/18); CityU SRG(grant numbers:7004882,7005216,7005122,9678180); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460310","Accuracy improvement;debug;deep learning (DL) models;efficiency;error reduction;fixing;model convergence","Training;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Data models;Neurons;Convergence","","","","50","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper reports two additional such features: a) The destinations of people (or we say waypoints) are dispersed in a self-similar manner; and b) people are more likely to choose a destination closer to its current waypoint. These features are known to be influential to the performance of human-assisted mobility networks. The main contribution of this paper is to present a mobility model called Self-similar Least-Action Walk (SLAW) that can produce synthetic mobility traces containing all the five statistical features in various mobility settings including user-created virtual ones for which no empirical information is available. Creating synthetic traces for virtual environments is important for the performance evaluation of mobile networks as network designers test their networks in many diverse network settings.

In addition, a file in the collection can be (further) compressed by identifying common strings within the file itself. At the cost of decompression latency, but a possible gain in compression effectiveness, an LZ-style within-file compressor could resolve these references to other files. To quantify the compression gain, we experiment with a variety of file collections, from emails to source code, and test against multiple measures. If the LZ scheme honors the inter-file references, then there is only minimal improvement. If the LZ algorithm replaces inter-file references with intra-file references, then up to 3% compression improvement is witnessed for mildly similar files, and over 200% improvement for highly similar files.","2379-7703","978-1-4799-5057-7","10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906778","Differential compression;LZ factorization","Electronic mail;Encoding;Dictionaries;Encyclopedias;Indexes;Measurement;Compression algorithms","","3","","18","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing mechanisms for plagiarism detection mainly apply superficial and brute-force string matching techniques. Such well-known metrics, widely used to discover similarities in text documents, cannot work well in discovering similarities in music compositions. Despite the wide-spread belief that few notes in common between two songs is enough to decide whether a plagiarism exists, the analysis of similarities is a very complex process. In this work, we provide novel perspectives in the field of automatic music plagiarism detection, and specifically, we propose an approach based on a fuzzy vectorial-based similarity. Given a suspicious melody, our approach envisions three steps: (1) its transformation in a vectorial representation, (2) retrieving of a list of similar melodies, (3) analysis and comparison with this subset of associated similar scores by using a fuzzy degree of similarity, that varies in a range between 0 for melodies that are fully musically different, and 1 for identical melodies.

However, it is a quite challenging problem due to the subtle interclass difference and large intraclass variation. Recently, visual attention models have been applied to automatically localize the discriminative regions of an image for better capturing critical difference, which have demonstrated promising performance. Unfortunately, without consideration of the diversity in attention process, most of existing attention models perform poorly in classifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we propose a diversified visual attention network (DVAN) to address the problem of fine-grained object classification, which substantially relieves the dependency on strongly supervised information for learning to localize discriminative regions compared with attention-less models. More importantly, DVAN explicitly pursues the diversity of attention and is able to gather discriminative information to the maximal extent. Multiple attention canvases are generated to extract convolutional features for attention. An LSTM recurrent unit is employed to learn the attentiveness and discrimination of attention canvases. The proposed DVAN has the ability to attend the object from coarse to fine granularity, and a dynamic internal representation for classification is built up by incrementally combining the information from different locations and scales of the image. Extensive experiments conducted on CUB-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars datasets have demonstrated that the pro-posed DVAN achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, without using any prior knowledge, user interaction, or external resource in training and testing.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2648498","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61373121,61328205); Program for Sichuan Provincial Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:13QNJJ0149); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201507000032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7807286","Deep learning;fine-grained object classification;long-short-term-memory (LSTM);visual attention","Visualization;Feature extraction;Birds;Predictive models;Diversity reception;Dogs;Training","","325","","55","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recently proposed stable matching-based selection provides a new perspective to handle this balance under the framework of decomposition multiobjective optimization. In particular, the one-one stable matching between subproblems and solutions, which achieves an equilibrium between their mutual preferences, is claimed to strike a balance between convergence and diversity. However, the original stable marriage model has a high risk of matching a solution with an unfavorable subproblem, which finally leads to an imbalanced selection result. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incomplete preference lists into the stable matching model to remedy the loss of population diversity. In particular, each solution is only allowed to maintain a partial preference list consisting of its favorite subproblems. We implement two versions of stable matching-based selection mechanisms with incomplete preference lists: one achieves a two-level one-one matching and the other obtains a many-one matching. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is developed to automatically set the length of the incomplete preference list for each solution according to its local competitiveness.

In this paper we propose SCS, a novel method for measuring the similarity between categorical sequences, based on an original pattern matching scheme that makes it possible to capture chronological and non-chronological dependencies. SCS captures significant patterns that represent the natural structure of sequences, and reduces the influence of those representing noise. It constitutes an effective approach for measuring the similarity of data such as biological sequences, natural language texts and financial transactions. To show its effectiveness, we have tested SCS extensively on a range of datasets, and compared the results with those obtained by various mainstream algorithms.","2374-8486","978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781129","","Sequences;Data mining;Proteins;Costs;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Natural languages;Application software;Algorithm design and analysis;Noise reduction","","9","","27","IEEE","10 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If text strings are visible on their surfaces, we can extract the semantic features of objects, thereby recognizing and clustering them. Thus, this method is based on semantic information.

Three use cases are presented in order to showcase the potential benefits. By the use of a user-space AP, which works in coordination with a controller, the network is able to assign each connected station to the AP that best fits with its characteristics. The system also manages security, avoiding the need of adding specific elements for authentication, encryption or decryption. Extensions are proposed to an existing protocol that defines the communication between the AP and the controller, in order to communicate and store the specific characteristics of each AP and end device. This includes new association and handoff schemes that do not introduce any additional delay. The system has been implemented in a real environment, and a battery of tests has been run using three hardware platforms of different characteristics. The results show that handoffs between bands are possible, and estimate the processing delays, the Round-Trip Time and the handoff delay, which is small enough in order not to produce any significant disruption to the user (10-50 ms).

Small datasets limit the depth of DNNs implementable, and limit performance. In this work, a novel method for generating diversified radar micro-Doppler signatures using Kinect-based motion capture simulations is proposed as a training database for transfer learning with DNNs. In particular, it is shown that together with residual learning, the proposed DivNet approach allows for the construction of DNNs and offers improved performance in comparison to transfer learning from optical imagery. Furthermore, it is shown that initializing the network using diversified synthetic micro-Doppler signatures enables not only robust performance for previously unseen target profiles, but also class generalization.

This paper presents a Raft implementation, i.e., gRaft, that enables precise auto scaling on spot markets. gRaft extends Raft with the following abstractions: (1) secretaries which relieve log processing from leader nodes and (2) observers which relieve read requests from followers. These abstractions are stateless, allowing for elastic auto scaling, even with unreliable spot instances. gRaft preserves strong consistency guarantees provided by Raft. We set up and tested gRaft with multiple auto scaling techniques using traces from Google. gRaft scales in resource footprint increments 5-7X smaller than Multi-Raft, the state of the art.

Our study reveals that I/O arrivals at the block level are very complex in modern cloud storage. There is a certain degree of correlation in the long-term timescale for request arrival intervals in AliCloud and Systor’17_read. Request arrival intervals in MSRC, FIU and Systor’17_write, however, are almost uncorrelated. The Gaussianity test confirms that I/O burstiness appears to be Gaussian in AliCloud_write and Systor’17_read, but the burstiness is non-Gaussian in other workloads. Importantly, we unfold the existence of self-similarity in cloud storage workloads with a certain degree of correlations, via visual evidence, the autocorrelation structure of the aggregated process of I/O request sequences, and Hurst parameter estimates.

To date, MIMO communication using large dimensions has not been implemented for commercial systems. But the potential capacity of MIMO is much more significant when the MIMO dimensions become large. The hold-up is not just the shortfall in understanding how to deploy large-dimension MIMO, but also how to design the antenna systems. There is no widely agreed method for evaluating MEAs used by MIMO communications. Even the performance evaluation of a well-established MIMO configuration, such as the small scale systems already used, remains limited. The evaluation often defers to OTA tests in artificial environmental conditions. The real-world performance remains unclear, so care must be taken in design optimization. In this paper, we discuss the incorporation of some physical modeling of the propagation environment to evaluating the MEA performance for a typical urban wireless channel. A ray-optic method is applicable to any 3D environment, and any number of antennas with arbitrary patterns. In this sense it offers a practical approach for large-dimension MIMO evaluation by being able to change the antennas and the environment, all in software. The evaluation method is illustrated by using an MEA slot cube (12 antennas) operating in a specific environment, namely downtown Ottawa.","2164-3342","978-8-8907-0184-9","10.1109/EuCAP.2014.6902535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902535","physical modeling;ray-tracing;multiport antenna;MIMO;diversity gain;diversity combining","Diversity reception;MIMO;Antenna measurements;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas","","1","","18","","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In academia, the stability and accuracy properties of PHIL simulations are often evaluated using the transfer functions of the open- or closed-loop systems. The results are then used to design the interfacing algorithm that couples the hardware with the software side. But this approach typically requires detailed prior knowledge, which is frequently different from practical applications where little or no information is available about the hardware under test. Lacking a benchmark model, it is therefore rather difficult to predict what accuracy can be achieved in practice with a given interface. To avoid modeling all components of the PHIL system, this paper aims to establish the interpretation of the interfacing algorithm as an isolated two-port network. Considering the inputs and outputs as vectors, it is shown how the transmission properties of PHIL interfaces can be predicted for different frequencies and steady-state inputs. In addition, a new measure for evaluating the accuracy via the cosine similarity is proposed, which automatically combines the amplitude and phase characteristics in the calculation. Finally, simulations illustrate the applicability of the presented methodology.","2831-3658","979-8-3503-2700-7","10.1109/eGrid58358.2023.10380883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10380883","Accuracy;cosine similarity;interfacing algorithm;power-hardware-in-the-loop;real-time simulation","Simulation;Current measurement;Software algorithms;Transfer functions;Prediction algorithms;Hardware;Stability analysis","","","","17","IEEE","9 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quality-diversity evolutionary approaches optimise for novelty as well as performance, and can be used to generate a repertoire of diverse designs. This design repertoire could be used as a tool to guide a designer and kick-start the rapid prototyping process. This paper explores this idea in the context of mechanical linkage based robots. These robots can be a good test-bed for rapid prototyping, as they can be modified quickly for swift iterations in design. We compare three evolutionary algorithms for optimising 2D mechanical linkages: 1) a standard evolutionary algorithm, 2) the multi-objective algorithm NSGA-II, and 3) the quality-diversity algorithm MAP-Elites. Some of the found linkages are then realized on a physical hexapod robot through a prototyping process, and tested on two different floors. We find that all the tested approaches, except the standard evolutionary algorithm, are capable of finding mechanical linkages that creates a path similar to a specified desired path. However, the quality-diversity approaches that had the length of the linkage as a behaviour descriptor were the most useful when prototyping. This was due to the quality-diversity approaches having a larger variety of similar designs to choose from, and because the search could be constrained by the behaviour descriptors to make linkages that were viable for construction on our hexapod platform.","","978-1-6654-8768-9","10.1109/SSCI51031.2022.10022197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10022197","Robots;Mechanical linkages;Evolutionary algorithms;Quality-Diversity","Couplings;Legged locomotion;Design automation;Evolutionary computation;Rapid prototyping;Robots;Standards","","","","29","IEEE","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite advances in complex tasks such as object tracking, human behavior modeling, activity recognition, and trajectory planning, the fundamental challenge of interpretable scene understanding, especially in out-of-distribution environments, remains evident. This is highlighted by the 84% of AV disengagements attributed to scene understanding errors in real-world AV tests. To address this limitation, we introduce the Diverse Naturalistic Edge Driving Scene Dataset (DivNEDS), a novel dataset comprising 11,084 edge scenes and 203,000 descriptive captions sourced from 12 distinct locations worldwide, captured under varying weather conditions and at different times of the day. Our approach includes a novel embedded hierarchical dense captioning strategy aimed at enabling few-shot learning and mitigating overfitting by excluding irrelevant scene elements. Additionally, we propose a Generative Region-to-Text Transformer, with a baseline embedded hierarchical dense captioning performance of 60.3mAP, a new benchmark for AV scene understanding models trained on dense captioned data sets. This work represents a significant step toward improving AVs’ ability to comprehend diverse, real-world edge and complex driving scenarios, thereby enhancing their safety and adaptability in dynamic environments.

Distinctively more aggressive than its counterparts, melanoma possesses a higher propensity to metastasize, rendering it one of the most formidable types of skin cancer. Given its rapid invasion and propensity for widespread metastasis, prompt and accurate diagnosis, followed by immediate intervention, is imperative. Fine-grained classification tasks are particularly pertinent in this context, aiming to discern between closely resembling subclasses, a challenge akin to differentiating subtle visual nuances among similar-appearing skin pathologies. Consequently, fine-grained classification emerges as a critical tool in the nuanced diagnosis, early detection, and ongoing surveillance of skin diseases. In response, we have developed a innovative network, termed Multimodal Hybrid Approach for Fine-Grained Classification of Diverse Dermatological Conditions (MultiFG), adept at handling a variety of skin conditions. This model proficiently extracts and processes metadata while concurrently capturing visual details through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is followed by the integration of visual and metadata insights within a Transformer architecture, facilitating enhanced fusion and refined fine-grained analysis. Our proposed methodology’s efficacy is substantiated through rigorous testing on two distinct datasets, where it has demonstrated promising results.","","979-8-3503-6009-7","10.1109/CIPCV61763.2024.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10624415","skin diseases;fine-grained classification;hybrid model;multimodal","Visualization;Computer vision;Melanoma;Metadata;Transformers;Feature extraction;Skin","","","","28","IEEE","14 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we address the problem of clone detection applied to plagiarism detection in the context of source code assignments done by computer science students. Plagiarism detection comes with a distinct set of constraints to usual clone detection approaches, which influenced the design of the approach we present in this paper. For instance, the source code can be heavily changed at a superficial level (in an attempt to look genuine), yet be functionally very similar. Since assignments turned in by computer science students can be in a variety of languages, we work at the syntactic level and do not consider the source-code semantics. Consequently, the approach we propose is endogenous and makes no assumption about the programming language being analysed. It is based on an alignment method using the parallel principle at local resolution (character level) to compute similarities between documents. We tested our framework on hundreds of real source files, involving a wide array of programming languages (Java, C, Python, PHP, Haskell, bash). Our approach allowed us to discover previously undetected frauds, and to empirically evaluate its accuracy and robustness.","","978-1-4244-8655-7","10.1109/SCAM.2010.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601829","Endogenous;Plagiarism Detection;Similarity Measure;Distance;Source Code Segmentation;Source Code Plagiarism","Cloning;Plagiarism;Computer languages;Context;Robustness;Software systems","","31","","24","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we apply the formalism for granule formation proposed by us and studied over last few years which is based on similarity measures called Rough Inclusions. A proper study of rough inclusions has been done within Rough Mereology, a paradigm for approximate reasoning that is rooted in the theory of concepts called Mereology based on the notion of a part instead on the notion of an element like the naive concept theory. We give an outline of granulation theory based on rough inclusions; then, we discuss the most important consequence of similarity among objects in a granule, viz., the hypothesis that granules represent new objects, which preserve the most important features of objects in a granule. This leads to the notion of a granular decision system obtained by means of granulation from an original decision system. The hypothesis that granular decision systems reflect properties of original decision systems to a satisfactory degree, put forth by the author at 2005 and 2006 IEEE GrC conferences, has been tested with very good results. We include here some results of those tests.

Therefore, when we deal with a large number of datasets, there should be a way to accelerate the process by applying acceleration techniques to optimize the plagiarism detection. In response to this, we have developed a parallel algorithm using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and tested it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. An equivalent algorithm is run on CPU platform as well. From the comparison of the results, CPU shows better performance when the number and the size of the documents are small. Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU.

Design of communication systems can be facilitated using channel modeling. Dual polarized MIMO-LMS channel is complex with many factors influencing the channel. The ionospheric, tropospheric effects along with mobility of the user equipment are some of the parameters that make the LMS channel model unique. Widely used dual polarized LMS MIMO channel model Loo is analyzed. Loo is a statistical model which can analyze statistical parameters of the channel. Thus the models have best captured the ionospheric, tropospheric and fading effects for a LMS system. Critical channel parameters like Scatter plot, Auto correlation function (ACF), Doppler spectrum, Correlation coefficient and Outage capacity has been analyzed and a coding scheme that jointly utilizes space, time and polarization diversities is considered for better reliability.

Unpredictable system's algorithms change does not allow to use knowledge, gained by an attacker during system's examination, or to perform long-term preparation or resources redistribution with the aim of its discredit. Methodology that allows proving an unpredictable character of information system modification, despite accessibility of its program code for all participants and procedure of new algorithms generation in untrusted program environment, was suggested in this observation. The process can be built on the base of recursive program modification by itself. Another method is to use an open procedure of modification by system's participants with confirmation of changes correctness according to Proof of Necessity of Change - PNC model. A prototype of distributed registry with the protection against examination (BlurChain) was suggested as an example of methodology implementation.

The majority of models of spectrum usage are not suitable for this specific use case as they are based on measurement campaigns conducted in urban or controlled laboratory environments. In this work we present a time-domain traffic model for industrial communication in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, medical (ISM) band based on measurements in an industrial automotive production site. As DSA is usually implemented on Software Defined Radios (SDR), our measurement campaign is based on SDR platforms rather than sophisticated spectrum analyzers. We show through the estimation of the Hurst parameter that industrial wireless traffic possesses inherent self-similarity that could be exploited for efficient DSA. We also show that wireless traffic could be modeled as a semi-Markov model with channel on and off durations Log-normally and Pareto distributed, respectively. We finally estimate the parameters of the derived models using Maximum Likelihood estimation.","","978-1-5090-2494-0","10.1109/WD.2016.7461492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7461492","Traffic Modeling;Dynamic Spectrum Access;Industrial Communication;Self-similarity","Wireless communication;Estimation;Industrial communication;Production facilities;Wireless sensor networks;Time-domain analysis;Adaptation models","","4","","20","IEEE","2 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rapid growth of this technology, more and more IT services providers compete to offer high-quality and cost-effective cloud services that best fulfill their customers' needs. Given the vast diversity of these offers, the choice of the most appropriate Cloud Service Provider (CSP) became a dilemma that confuses most cloud customers. Many diverged criteria have to be considered to precisely evaluate services offered by several CSPs, some of these criteria cannot be quantified easily such as usability and security. The selection of the best CSP is thus a complex Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem that needs to be addressed efficiently. Previous studies of this problem employed MCDM methods that are either unfeasible when it is difficult or meaningless to quantify alternatives over criteria or computationally expensive and inconsistent when relative preferences of alternatives and criteria are used instead. In this paper, we propose a novel MCDM approach that is feasible, efficient and consistent using relative preferences of criteria and alternatives. The proposed approach incorporates Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Best Worst Method (BWM) to rank CSPs using evaluation criteria characterizing their services. The integrated approach has been tested and validated through a use-case scenario which demonstrates its effectiveness and correctness. We have also compared the proposed approach to the most commonly used MCDM approach, Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms AHP in terms of computational complexity and consistency; hence, it is more efficient and reliable than AHP.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987111","Research Center of College of Computer and Information Sciences (CRC) at King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063529","Cloud computing (CC);cloud service providers (CSPs);multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM);best worst method (BWM);technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS);analytical hierarchical process (AHP)","Cloud computing;Decision making;Reliability;Software as a service;Security;Operating systems;Computational complexity","","79","","75","CCBY","10 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through the construction of petroleum engineering information integration platform, the establishment of geological document key information dictionary and the construction of geological document key information extraction template library, the key information extraction method based on natural language processing is optimized. On the basis of the above research, the geological document information extraction module is developed to realize the information fusion between the drilling major and the geological major. After testing 100 geological documents, the key information extraction software developed in this paper shows that the extraction accuracy of key information is 98%, and the average extraction time of a single text is 10s. The extraction efficiency and accuracy are higher than expected, and fully meet the needs of drilling design. This paper provides ideas for the information construction of other majors in the traditional oil industry, breaks the information island between different majors, realizes the inter-professional information exchange, and greatly improves the work efficiency and benefit of the traditional oil industry.","2832-3734","979-8-3503-7355-4","10.1109/ICCCBDA61447.2024.10569640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10569640","Information fusion;digital transformation;Natural language processing;Cosine similarity algorithm;Key information extraction","Drilling;Analytical models;Accuracy;Geology;Information retrieval;Data mining;Petroleum industry","","","","9","IEEE","28 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, virtualization and virtual machines are among the most efficient approaches to improving computer performance. This research is to describe, study, and verify adaptive models of virtualized CS by using servers configured similarly to such models; the researchers also seek to develop a method for making adaptive virtualization-based CS models. The research is to produce a procedure for experimental making and verification of mathematical virtualized-CS models; the procedure will create a virtual server on a host platform and monitor its performance under heavy load. Virtualization can use hardware and firmware, or software (OS level). This paper considers natural virtualization. Known models are not applicable to virtualized CS, as they cannot run comprehensive analysis to find the most efficient way of initial resource distribution and to optimize such distribution for a particular application. The mathematics this paper uses is the closed queueing networks (CQN). Experiments produced simple models for analyzing various CS structures. To be adaptive, the models use triggers that track and adjust the processing channel power in individual queueing systems (QS) to a particular application. The conclusions present the findings of this research. Experiments prove the obtained results reliable and usable as a flexible tool for studying the virtualization properties when structuring a CS. This knowledge could be of use for businesses interested in optimizing the server configuration for their IT infrastructure, e.g. for testing, remote offices, etc., since renting a virtual server is cheaper than buying one.","","978-1-7281-0265-8","10.1109/RUSAUTOCON.2019.8867620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8867620","adaptive model;verification;virtual server;computational system;natural resource virtualization;mathematical modeling;closed queueing network","Mathematical model;Servers;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Virtualization;Data models;Load modeling","","4","","23","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ransomware carries out an irreversible process, where it encrypts victims' digital assets to seek financial compensations. Adversaries utilize different means to gain initial access to the target machines, such as phishing emails, vulnerable public-facing software, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), brute-force attacks, and stolen accounts. To combat these threats of ransomware, this paper aims to help researchers gain a better understanding of ransomware application profiles through static analysis, where we identify a list of suspicious indicators and similarities among 727 active ran-somware samples. We start with generating portable executable (PE) metadata for all the studied samples. With our domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis tasks, we introduce some of the suspicious indicators of the structure of ransomware files. We reduce the dimensionality of the generated dataset by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and discover clusters by applying the KMeans algorithm. This motivates us to utilize the one-class classification algorithms on the generated dataset. As a result, the algorithms learn the common data boundary in the structure of our studied ransomware samples, and thereby, we achieve the data-driven similarities. We use the findings to evaluate the trained classifiers with the test samples and observe that the Local Outlier Factor (LoF) performs better on all the selected feature spaces compared to the One-Class SVM and the Isolation Forest algorithms.","","978-1-7281-9048-8","10.1109/SSCI50451.2021.9660019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660019","Machine Learning;Ransomware;Static Analysis","Support vector machines;Data analysis;Clustering algorithms;Forestry;Metadata;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Ransomware;Task analysis;Principal component analysis","","3","","24","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On one hand, we adopt uniform random allocation strategy to assign particles into different groups and in each group the losers will learn from the winner.

Although lots of machine learning methods have been proposed, great challenges arise with boom of precision medicine. On one hand, many methods are based on the assumption that similar drugs may share same side effects, but measuring the drug-drug similarity appropriately is challenging. One the other hand, multi-source data provide diverse information for the analysis of side effects, and should be integrated for the high-accuracy prediction. In this paper, we tackle the side effect prediction problem through linear neighborhoods and multi-source data integration. In the feature space, linear neighborhoods are constructed to extract the drug-drug similarity, namely “linear neighborhood similarity”. By transferring the similarity into the side effect space, known side effect information is propagated through the similarity-based graph. Thus, we propose the linear neighborhood similarity method (LNSM), which utilizes single-source data for the side effect prediction. Further, we extend LNSM to deal with multi-source data, and propose two data integration methods: similarity matrix integration method (LNSM-SMI) and cost minimization integration method (LNSM-CMI), which integrate drug substructure data, drug target data, drug transporter data, drug enzyme data, drug pathway data and drug indication data to improve the prediction accuracy. The proposed methods are evaluated on the benchmark datasets. The linear neighborhood similarity method (LNSM) can produce satisfying results on the single-source data. Data integration methods (LNSM-SMI and LNSM-CMI) can effectively integrate multi-source data, and outperform other state-of-the-art side effect prediction methods in the cross validation and independent test. The proposed methods are promising for the drug side effect prediction.","","978-1-5090-1611-2","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822555","side effects;data integration;drug-drug similarity","Drugs;Data integration;Biochemistry;Chemicals;Predictive models;Databases;Learning systems","","40","","39","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the proposed scheme, initially, some pre-processing techniques are employed to enhance image quality and extract text-lines from each handwritten document image. For each extracted text-line, a set of 92 features are computed based on analysis of connected component, enclosed region, lower and upper contours, fractal code, and Curve let. Considering the extracted feature vectors, a histogram is created for each feature of every writer as a histogram-valued symbolic data. This process results in a handwriting style model for each individual that consists of a set of histograms. To evaluate the proposed scheme, two different handwritten datasets written in two different scripts (Kannada as an Indian based script and English) were used. The first dataset contains 228 pages written in Kannada by 57 people. The other one is the dataset used in SigWiComp2013 composed of 330 document pages written in English by 55 individuals. The same criteria used in the SigWiComp2013 were followed in our evaluation strategy. Concerning the Kannada dataset, an F-measure of 92.79% was obtained when 114 documents were used in learning stage and the rest (114) were used for testing.

The bats are equipped with a sensor node of only 2 g that limits the energy budget available for communication. In this work, we exploit the distributed nature of the ground network to employ diversity combining, i.e., we use the ground nodes as a geographically distributed multi-antenna array. However, this causes several research challenges given the limited bandwidth between nodes and the need for accurate synchronization to combine signal copies constructively at a central node. Sending all signal samples from all ground nodes to the central node is prohibitive due to the required data rates in the network. As a novel concept, we propose a system that only forwards selected signal samples belonging to a packet with high probability. We study the performance in simulations as well as in a testbed using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) prototype implementation. Our results clearly indicate a substantial performance gain while keeping the data rate in the ground network in a feasible range.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-8999-0","10.1109/ICC.2017.7996320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7996320","","Diversity reception;Receivers;Diversity methods;Mobile nodes;Bandwidth;Synchronization","","4","","15","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this article explores an idea to control the rates of only a few service flows so that the rates of all uncontrolled flows allocated by TCP will meet their QoS requirements. We design a new architecture, called Scalable Per-Flow Rate Allocation (SPFRA), and formulate a new optimization problem, termed Scalable Rate Allocation for Aggregate Flows (SRAF), to find a minimum number of controlled flows to increase the scalability of SDN with diverse service requirements. We prove the NP-hardness and inapproximability of SRAF. To solve the problem, we design an algorithm, named Aggregate Flow Selection and Flow Release (AFSFR), to achieve the tightest bound and extend it to support distributed computation and dynamic traffic for instant services.

Different radio channel models corresponding to various scenarios and environments (urban, suburban, indoor, outdoor, SFN) have been tested and compared. For a single antenna scenario, it is shown that for the same environments, the COST207 and 3GPP channel models offer almost a similar performance. Moreover, it is found that in the case of indoor channel reception (WLAN profiles) and for a carrier to noise ratio (C/N) of 15-20 dB, the receiver maintains an acceptable level of pcBER for proper audio decoding. This observation also applies to the recently proposed DVB-H multipath channel profiles, except for the motorway rural channel (MR) at 100 km/h where the receiver fails to operate correctly at this mobile speed. In dual-antenna scenarios, the maximal ratio combining (MRC) diversity technique provides a clear improvement to the performance of the dual-antenna based DAB/DMB receiver for all multipath channel profiles tested.

That's why increasing current students' ocean and overall Earth science literacy is so important and a primary goal of the American Meteorological Society (AMS). To this end, the AMS has created a suite of introductory, undergraduate-level courses that have already engaged approximately a hundred thousand students in the Earth sciences. AMS Ocean Studies, AMS Weather Studies, and AMS Climate Studies have been developed by the AMS with support from NSF, NOAA, and NASA and are designed to be adaptable to traditional, hybrid, or online instructional settings. Course components include a comprehensive textbook (ebook only for AMS Climate Studies; printed or ebook options for AMS Ocean and Weather Studies), eInvestigations Manual, course website, faculty website, and a faculty resource CD. Instructors can use these materials in any combination that best suits their needs. The 3rd edition Ocean Studies textbook features topics such as ocean acidification, harmful algal blooms, the use of ocean currents as an alternative energy source, along with a detailed look at the essential role the ocean plays in Earth's climate system. The textbook also reviews the latest technology for monitoring ocean properties including floats and gliders and cabled ocean observatories. The newest version of the climate studies textbook, Our Changing Climate, is currently under revision and was released for the fall 2014 semester. A greater focus on climate change issues as well as new chapters detailing human and ecosystem vulnerabilities to climate change, energy and geopolitical issues, and climate change denial are a few highlights in the new text. Additionally, new findings from the IPCC AR5 report and the USGCRP National Climate Assessment will be included along with mitigation and adaptation solutions to climate change issues. Updated yearly, the eInvestigations Manuals contain 30 laboratory activities and innovatively connects with a third online component, Current Ocean/Weather/Climate Studies, via the RealTime Ocean/Weather/Climate Portals. These online investigations reference data from NOAA, NOS, reports from the IPCC, USGCRP and contain real-world data from other lead scientific organizations. The RealTime Ocean/Weather/Climate Portals is an all-inclusive webpage that provides links to numerous external sources that further engage students. Instructor support materials are available with each course and include a faculty CD that contains a faculty manual with learning objectives and suggestions for course implementation, as well as investigations manual answer forms compatible with any course management system, test bank questions and answers, textbook images, and PowerPoint® presentations for each chapter. The investigations manual answer forms are files compatible with Respondus®, test-generating software for which many institutions are licensed (answer forms are also provided in Respondus® format). The faculty member has the option of delivering questions through their course management system to allow automatic scoring and immediate results for their students. This feature allows for full integration to a college's e-learning environment. AMS Ocean Studies also offers a unique way to study marine science through the use of Google Earth-based animations and other similar data visualization tools, such as NOAA View that allows students to view satellite, model, and other data and export high-resolution images. These tools bring oceanography to life! The AMS believes that students are truly motivated to learn when they can relate to the topic. That is why use of current, real-world data is vital to all three of the courses. A few examples include the 2011 Japan earthquake/tsunami event, the 2012 record-low Arctic sea ice, and Superstorm Sandy. In all of these instances, online activities were created as these events were occurring; students learned the science as it was happening! AMS Ocean Studies, AMS Weather Studies, and AMS Climate Studies can be taught by experienced science faculty or those new to teaching the subject matter. Mentoring by AMS-trained course instructors is available to all new instructors. These courses aim to interest all students in the geosciences and increase scientific literacy through the use of real-world data.","0197-7385","978-1-4799-4918-2","10.1109/OCEANS.2014.7003014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7003014","ocean;climate;water;course;online;diversity","Oceans;Meteorology;Educational institutions;Earth;Manuals;US Government agencies;Conferences","","","","6","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the symbol-level synchronization requirement among distributed relays limits its use in practice. We propose to circumvent this barrier with a cross-layer protocol called Distributed Asynchronous Cooperation (DAC). With DAC, multiple relays can schedule concurrent transmissions with packet-level (hence coarse) synchronization. The receiver then extracts multiple versions of each relayed packet via a collision-resolution algorithm, thus realizing the diversity gain of cooperative communication. We demonstrate the feasibility of DAC by prototyping and testing it on the GNURadio/USRP software radio platform. To explore its relevance at the network level, we introduce a DAC-based medium access control (MAC) protocol, and a generic approach to integration of the DAC MAC/PHY layer into a typical routing algorithm. Considering the use of DAC for multiple network flows, we analyze the fundamental tradeoff between the improvement in diversity gain and the reduction in multiplexing opportunities. DAC is shown to improve the throughput and delay performance of lossy networks with intermediate link quality. Our analytical results have also been confirmed via network-level simulation with ns-2.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2341611","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1160775,CNS-1317411,CNS-1318292); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862056","Relay network;cooperative communications;asynchronous cooperative relaying;cross-layer design;diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","Relays;Receivers;Channel estimation;Synchronization;Estimation;Transmitters;Protocols","","6","","34","IEEE","22 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the stochastic mobility of EVs makes dispatch difficult and requires modeling the spatial and temporal distribution of EV availability. In this paper, a trip-chain-based EV resource aggregation model considering EV flexibility similarity is developed. Then, a bilevel optimization model is formulated to enable participation of the EV aggregators (EAGGs) in the day-ahead dispatch while ensuring various system operation constraints. Finally, the proposed bilevel model is transformed into a single-level convex optimization problem that can be conveniently solved by off-the-shelf software. Simulation tests substantiate that the proposed approach is superior to the existing method in terms of higher computational efficiency and lower system operation cost.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2021.3130547","Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20210324130811031); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515012450); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9626649","Trip chain;spatial and temporal distribution;flexibility similarity;aggregation;day-ahead market;auxiliary services","Costs;Batteries;Mathematical models;State of charge;Probabilistic logic;Systems operation;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","32","","54","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Tag clustering algorithm LMMSK: Improved K-means algorithm based on latent semantic analysis","J. Yang; J.

Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is srstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identiscation or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.02.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7921809","tag clustering algorithm;K-means;latent semantic analysis (LSA);min-max similarity (MMS);social tagging","Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Semantics;Tagging;Clustering methods;Web 2.0;Data processing","","12","","","","11 May 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Because model validation plays a key role in system simulation for analysis and optimization of railgun, a novel validation method is proposed in this paper. By utilizing the railgun dynamic test and predicted data, the simulation model is validated based on theil's inequality coefficient (TIC) method. To execute sufficient validation of the model and improve reliability of the validation results, similarity theory is adopted to analyze the credibility of simulation model by comparing the characteristics of the railgun. Inspired by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for multiple attribute decision making, we define the muzzle velocity, current peak and discharging time as evaluation index for assessing the credibility of the simulation model and then evaluation structure is established. The final synthesis results demonstrate the feasibility of the adopted validation method and the validity of the modular model. The whole system model is run under MATLAB software platform, which is divided into several main components encapsulated into classes by object-oriented technology. On the basis of the validated model, an optimization pursuing highest velocity with the constraint of the current peak and the residual current in the rail is carried out to find a set of optimal parameters for the railgun using genetic algorithm.","","978-1-4673-0305-7","10.1109/EML.2012.6325055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6325055","modularized design;model validation;similarity theory;analytic hierarchy process;optimization;genetic algorithm;electromagnetic railgun","Mathematical model;Railguns;Optimization;Rails;Object oriented modeling;Projectiles;Analytical models","","10","","15","IEEE","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenge is how to find the right Web services efficiently and effectively for a given development task. There have been many efforts on developing techniques or systems to search services. Though effective in certain scenarios, existing techniques do not form systems for public use; or are based on one query modal--keyword query, which cannot give the matched services accurately. In this paper, we introduce proposed multimodal query search, where users can use keyword and file as query or custom the query. The multimodal query is based on an innovative similarity measure approach, which incorporates both semantic information and structural information of Web services. Our experiments and test cases validate the effectiveness of the approach. Compared with the alternative system Seekda, it is able to obtain much higher search accuracy with keyword query (with a match rate of 2-4 times higher than that of Seekda). The custom search can achieve 100% top-3 match rate, while Seekda fails in most cases using keywords.","","978-1-4673-2131-0","10.1109/ICWS.2012.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6257817","Web service search;multimodal query;similarity;semantic","Web services;Semantics;Vectors;Documentation;Keyword search;Electronic mail;Accuracy","","4","","33","IEEE","6 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even with numerous metrics and methods for intrusion detection and mitigation strategy, a complete detection and deterrence of cyber-attacks for ICS is impossible. Countering the impact and consequence of possible malfunctions caused by such attacks in the safety-critical ICS’s, this track talk proposes new controller architecture to failoperate even under compromised situations. The proposed new ICS is realized with diversification of hardware/software and unidirectional communication in alerting suspicious infiltration to upper-level management. Equipped with control bus monitoring, this operation-basis approach of infiltration detection would become a truly cyber-resilient ICS. The proposed system is tested in a lab hardware experimentation setup and on a cybersecurity test bed, DeterLab, for validation.","","978-1-9083-2063-6","10.1109/WCICSS.2016.7882939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7882939","","","","","","","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
