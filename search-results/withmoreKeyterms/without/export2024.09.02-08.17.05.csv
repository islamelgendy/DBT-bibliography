This deceitful act is usually referred as an intellectual theft which has swiftly increased with the rapid technological developments and information accessibility. Thus the need for a system/ mechanism for efficient plagiarism detection is at its urgency. In this paper, an investigation of different combined similarity metrics for extrinsic plagiarism detection is done and it focuses on unfolding the importance of combined similarity metrics over the commonly used single metric usage in plagiarism detection task. Further the impact of utilizing part of speech tagging (POS) in the plagiarism detection model is analyzed. Different combinations of the four single metrics, Cosine similarity, Dice coefficient, Match coefficient and Fuzzy-Semantic measure is used with and without POS tag information. These systems are evaluated using PAN1 -2014 training and test data set and results are analyzed and compared using standard PAN measures, viz, recall, precision, granularity and plagdet_score.","","978-1-4799-8792-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275838","Extrinsic Plagiarism;POS tagging;Vector Space Model;Single Metrics;Combined Metrics","Measurement;Plagiarism;Tagging;Semantics;Feature extraction;Training;Speech","","12","","19","IEEE","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we use natural language processing techniques to design a question answering system for the decision-making process in pressure vessel design. To solve the problem of insufficient training data for the technology question answering system, we propose a method to generate questions according to a declarative sentence from several different dimensions so that multiple question-answer pairs can be obtained from a declarative sentence. In addition, we designed an interactive attention model based on a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to improve the performance of the similarity comparison of two question sentences.

Based on the fundamental data-translation process, its successful outcome is guaranteed if mappings are low-level, i.e. they satisfy schema constraints. The problem is that if similar services have been identified based on high-level mappings, then schema constraints may be violated. To overcome this problem, we propose a proactive approach to identify similar services that satisfy schema constraints. In particular, our approach follows a composite workflow (instead of existing hybrid workflows), which determines schema constraints (service documents do not specify them) and estimates service-translation cost (actual cost is not available) as a function of ensured schema-constraints. We compare our approach against a state-of-the-art service-similarity approach on benchmark services and the results show that high service-similarity does not necessarily imply low service-translation cost, the bidirectional nature of service similarity can be misleading, ensured schema-constraints improve service similarity, and estimated translation-cost is very close to actual cost.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029761","service interface;high-level mapping;schema constraints;translation cost;composite workflow","Software;XML;Object oriented modeling;Benchmark testing;Estimation;Electronic mail;Measurement","","1","","29","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The PIL uses image data from the visualized FFT graph to detect robust points, and compares the average image similarity with a reference FFT template associated with a target of interest. Whereas, the KNN uses FFT-format csv files to compare the average distance similarity. Experiments were performed with the two methods.

This paper introduces a method for finding distinctive features of a shape that are useful for determining shape similarity. Although global shape descriptors have been developed to facilitate retrieval, they fail when local shape properties are the distinctive features of a class. Alternatively, local shape descriptors can be generated over the surface of shapes, but then storage and search of the descriptors becomes unnecessarily expensive, as perhaps only a few descriptors are sufficient to distinguish classes. The challenge is to select local descriptors from a query shape that are most distinctive for retrieval. Our approach is to define distinction as the retrieval performance of a local shape descriptor. During a training phase, we estimate descriptor likelihood using a multivariate Gaussian distribution of real-valued shape descriptors, evaluate the retrieval performance of each descriptor from a training set, and average these performance values at every likelihood value. For each query, we evaluate the likelihood of local shape descriptors on its surface and lookup the expected retrieval values learned from the training set to determine their predicted distinction values. We show that querying with the most distinctive shape descriptors provides favorable retrieval performance during tests with a database of common graphics objects.","","0-7695-2591-1","10.1109/SMI.2006.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631200","","Shape;Spatial databases;Information retrieval;Application software;Computer graphics;Computer science;Phase estimation;Gaussian distribution;Testing;Design automation","","31","1","26","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A distinctive-type of OCR is used to process Arabic characters, namely, Arabic OCR. OCR is increasingly used in many applications, where this process is preferred to automatically perform a process without human association. The Quranic text contains two elements, namely, diacritics and characters. However, processing these elements may cause malfunction to the OCR system and reduce its level of accuracy. In this paper, a new method is proposed to check the similarity and originality of Quranic content. This method is based on a combination of Quranic diacritic and character recognition techniques. Diacritic detections are performed using a region-based algorithm. An optimization technique is applied to increase the recognition ratio. Moreover, character recognition is performed based on the projection method. An optimization technique is applied to increase the recognition ratio. The result of the proposed method is compared with the standard Mushaf al Madinah benchmark to find similarities that match with texts of the Holy Quran.

However, attackers conceal a part of malicious data with evasion techniques to circumvent detection systems. In this paper, we propose a system for detecting malicious websites without collecting all malicious data. Even if we cannot observe a part of malicious data, we can always observe compromised websites. Since vulnerable websites are discovered by search engines, compromised websites have similar traits. Therefore, we built a classifier by leveraging not only malicious websites but also compromised websites. More precisely, we convert all websites observed at the time of access into a redirection graph and classify it by integrating similarities between its subgraphs and redirection subgraphs shared across malicious, benign, and compromised websites. As a result of evaluating our system with crawling data of 455,860 websites, we found that the system achieved a 91.7% true positive rate for malicious websites containing exploit URLs at a low false positive rate of 0.1%.

The match between corresponding regions, HSM considers the relationship of all spatial pairs in two images, which includes more meaningful match than SPM.

A minimalistic attack is a specialized form of adversarial attack that aims to accomplish successful attacks at the lowest possible cost. Recently, transfer optimization algorithms have been applied to deceive previously trained policies by acquiring knowledge from previously solved tasks. Experiments indicate that the transfer optimization algorithms perform well compared to traditional optimization algorithms. However, current transfer algorithms for addressing minimalistic attacks not only select a single source task for knowledge transfer but also tend to overly rely on identified appropriate source tasks. To address this issue, this paper introduces a similar locality based transfer evolutionary optimization algorithm. It can adaptively select multiple source tasks and extract valuable knowledge from these source tasks. Moreover, by leveraging the concept of similar locality, the algorithm alleviates its excessive dependence on familiar tasks, thereby providing fresh knowledge for the optimization of the target task. On this basis, the algorithm can mine more valuable knowledge from the large source task space to achieve a successful attack in a shorter period. The algorithm is tested on three Atari games-BeamRider, Qbert, and Seaquest-demonstrating its ability and potential to outperform other transfer optimization algorithms currently available in solving this problem.","","979-8-3503-0836-5","10.1109/CEC60901.2024.10611980","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62372081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10611980","Minimalistic attacks;transfer evolutionary optimization;similar locality;fresh knowledge","Sociology;Fitting;Optimization methods;Games;Reinforcement learning;Security;Task analysis","","","","34","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the framework of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on decomposition (MOEA/D), we propose a similarity-based MOEA to optimize this problem. The proposed algorithm is motivated by the population's perception on the decision variable space. The proposed algorithm perceives the decision variable space by deploying airships to latent regions. The perceptions of different solutions are related by the similarity between their deployments and utilized differently by crossover and mutation. The proposed algorithm is tested on five designed problems compared with MOEA/D with the other popular reproduction operators. We also test the proposed scheme integrated with another two popular algorithms. The experimental results show that the similarity-based MOEA/D outperforms the other algorithms significantly in detecting hotspots, tracking multiple hotspots and safely deploying airships for most cases.

One of the well-known strategies is to change randomly and more frequently the network IP addresses of critical clients so that the network locations of the clients are less recognizable. The goal is therefore to minimize the time that the location of a host computer is exposed to attackers. Several moving target defense mechanisms have been introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of IP address-based MTD strategies. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no study with its focus on investigating the impact of both the IP address change rate and the host diversity on the success of the defense and in turn the failure of attacks. We present the results of an analysis performed on simulating a simplified attack scenario against hosts on a network.

In this paper, we proposed a Lazy Stacking approach to classification (LS), a stacking framework with lazy local learning for building a classifier ensemble learner. Stacking is an ensemble that uses different “type” of base classifiers for labeling new instance. So by using stacking along with lazy learners, we can provide the desire accuracy. To investigate LS's performance, we test LS against four rival algorithms on a large suite of 10 real-world benchmark numeric datasets.

Transparency and quality management of these cloud characteristics are crucial for the market and customer acceptance of each cloud provider. The necessary prerequisite for this is the definition and standardization of measurement methods of cloud characteristics as they are defined by NIST. The definition of measurement methods and metrics from the perspective of cloud providers is not finalized yet. This paper introduces two metrics: (1) the system operation learning rate and (2) the system entropy rate in the context of ITIL processes.

At the very beginning, search is only conducted along the boundary direction vectors to achieve fast convergence, followed by the increase of the number of the direction vectors for approximating a more complete PF.

In addition, the incomplete multi-view data problem is ubiquitous in real world but has not been studied for multiple clusterings. To address these issues, we introduce a deep incomplete multi-view multiple clusterings (DiMVMC) framework, which achieves the completion of data view and multiple shared representations simultaneously by optimizing multiple groups of decoder deep networks. In addition, it minimizes a redundancy term to simultaneously control the diversity among these representations and among parameters of different networks.

This paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying suitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by comparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity measure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results, cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because, it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more preferable than the other.

Recently, hashing methods are used for fast nearest neighbor search in large-scale data spaces, by embedding high-dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. Inspired by this, in this paper, we introduce a novel supervised cross-modality hashing framework, which can generate unified binary codes for instances represented in different modalities. Particularly, in the learning phase, each bit of a code can be sequentially learned with a discrete optimization scheme that jointly minimizes its empirical loss based on a boosting strategy. In a bitwise manner, hash functions are then learned for each modality, mapping the corresponding representations into unified hash codes. We regard this approach as cross-modality sequential discrete hashing (CSDH), which can effectively reduce the quantization errors arisen in the oversimplified rounding-off step and thus lead to high-quality binary codes. In the test phase, a simple fusion scheme is utilized to generate a unified hash code for final retrieval by merging the predicted hashing results of an unseen instance from different modalities. The proposed CSDH has been systematically evaluated on three standard data sets: Wiki, MIRFlickr, and NUS-WIDE, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodality hashing techniques.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2619262","Northumbria University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61528106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7600368","Cross-modality retrieval;hashing;discrete optimization;bitwise;unified hash code","Binary codes;Optimization;Boosting;Semantics;Quantization (signal);Data structures;Electronic mail","","62","","56","IEEE","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rise of augmented reality technology has attracted wide attention in the field of complementary medicine. The safe and low delay augmented-reality assisted surgery system can effectively guide the accurate operation. At the same time, augmented reality technology can make surgical sites more intuitive. In this work, we propose a novel surgical operating system that leverages coordinate system transformation and optical navigation to improve precision and safety. Our approach involves the integration of medical images and optical tracking devices before and during surgery to achieve coordinate transformation between the patient’s position, surgical instruments, and the pre-surgery CT scan. This process involves calibration, registration, and other critical procedures. At the same time, the study also introduced the function of augmented reality. Doctors wearing augmented reality glasses can use the system to see more vivid scenes of surgery. During the calibration phase, we utilize biplanar and interpolation algorithms to obtain the conversion relationship between the C-arm emission source and the X-ray image coordinate system. In the registration stage, we convert the preoperative 3D CT into a DRR image using digital reconstruction image technology, which we then register with the 2D X-ray during the operation. To optimize the iteration, we employ the improved Powell algorithm. The algorithm demonstrates an average angle and position error of 0.62° and 0.56mm, respectively. Through the transformation of spatial position relationship, the transformation relationship between preoperative CT and intraoperative patient position was obtained. A user-friendly, integrated software system has been developed that allows users to view the relative relationship between surgical instruments and patient position in CT in real time during surgery. An augmented reality module has also been introduced, allowing operators to see specific surgical models in specific glasses. In this study, the establishment and model test of the algorithm were realized, thus providing auxiliary functions for high precision surgical operation.","2331-9569","979-8-3503-4581-0","10.1109/ICVR57957.2023.10169295","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10169295","augmented reality;2D/3D registration;digitally reconstructed radiograph;similarity measurement;optical navigation;Bi-plane calibration method","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Computed tomography;Instruments;Software algorithms;Surgery;Medical services","","","","18","IEEE","7 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This task, however, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and visual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing methods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve this task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global caption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information cannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we seek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of an image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1) it is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase; 2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts in an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still an open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method. Specifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid more attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor, we group its rel-evant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph (ACG). Last, based on different ACGs, we conduct the multi-view caption generation to improve the content diversity of generated captions. Experimental results show that our method not only achieves SOTA performance but also generates diverse captions to describe images.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578069","","Visualization;Computer vision;Image resolution;Benchmark testing;Pattern recognition;Proposals;Optical character recognition software","","32","","50","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After that, the camera parameters of the overlapped images and the reprojected 3D points in one model are refined using the obtained global similarity transform matrix. A precise similarity transform matrix between the two 3D models is then estimated from the inlier 2D-3D correspondences to accurately align and merge the two 3D models.

In this work, we apply the formalism for granule formation proposed by us and studied over last few years which is based on similarity measures called Rough Inclusions. A proper study of rough inclusions has been done within Rough Mereology, a paradigm for approximate reasoning that is rooted in the theory of concepts called Mereology based on the notion of a part instead on the notion of an element like the naive concept theory. We give an outline of granulation theory based on rough inclusions; then, we discuss the most important consequence of similarity among objects in a granule, viz., the hypothesis that granules represent new objects, which preserve the most important features of objects in a granule. This leads to the notion of a granular decision system obtained by means of granulation from an original decision system. The hypothesis that granular decision systems reflect properties of original decision systems to a satisfactory degree, put forth by the author at 2005 and 2006 IEEE GrC conferences, has been tested with very good results. We include here some results of those tests.","","978-1-4244-1327-0","10.1109/COGINF.2007.4341886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341886","Granules of knowledge;Rough sets;Similarity;Rough inclusions;Granular systems","Computer applications;Cognitive informatics;Uncertainty;Logic testing;Set theory;Application software;Information technology;Mathematics;Computer science;Machine intelligence","","3","","45","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the important challenges in this regard is the general inability of current APR techniques to produce patches that require edits in multiple locations, i.e., multi-hunk patches. In this work, we present a novel APR technique that generalizes single-hunk repair techniques to include an important class of multi-hunk bugs, namely bugs that may require applying a substantially similar patch at a number of locations. We term such sets of repair locations as evolutionary siblings - similar looking code, instantiated in similar contexts, that are expected to undergo similar changes. At the heart of our proposed method is an analysis to accurately identify a set of evolutionary siblings, for a given bug. This analysis leverages three distinct sources of information, namely the test-suite spectrum, a novel code similarity analysis, and the revision history of the project. The discovered siblings are then simultaneously repaired in a similar fashion. We instantiate this technique in a tool called HERCULES and demonstrate that it is able to correctly fix 46 bugs in the Defects4J dataset, the highest of any individual APR technique to date. This includes 15 multi-hunk bugs and overall 11 bugs which have not been fixed by any other technique so far.","1558-1225","978-1-7281-0869-8","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812131","automatic program repair, multi-hunk patches, code similarity","Maintenance engineering;Computer bugs;Cloning;Tools;History;Search problems;Syntactics","","54","","47","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The estimation is performed by utilizing an Adaptive Similarity-based Regression (ASR) approach. This constitutes the use of Support-Vector Regression (SVR) in conjunction with a similarity-based unlearning algorithm. It is demonstrated that this approach can adapt to the various properties of different mobile networks, while maintaining a fixed training set size. This is particularly useful in cases where training data is not available in large quantities, or the uplink rate is limited by the users subscription. ASR is developed as a set of modular components and as such can be used as an enhancement to protocols such as multipath Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), or as an aid to Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing. It is shown that the algorithm can achieve satisfactory performance with as little as 24 training samples, and can be deployed across different mobile networks without the need of pre-training. The solution is validated using a custom test-bed to perform mobile network measurements, gathering over 15, 000 measurement samples. In addition, the algorithm is tested using measurements collected under real life conditions both in a moving car and train. As there is a shortage of open source data in the field of rate estimation in mobile networks, we publish all of the data sets used in this paper to encourage further research on the subject.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.3000414","SCOTT from the Electronic Component Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:737422); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109551","Uplink data rate estimation;online learning;support-vector regression;similarity-based unlearning","Uplink;Estimation;Training;Logic gates;Sensors;Approximation algorithms;Neural networks","","8","","32","CCBY","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Community detection aims to extract these community structures from networks. Many community detection methods have been proposed that consider the problem from different perspectives. However, with the emergence of very large and complex networks from variety of domains, there has been a growing need for community detection methods that can operate at scale effectively and efficiently. Considering this, we propose a novel algorithm for large-scale community detection, based on two novel similarity indices we propose as well. In the first stage of our proposed algorithm, we generate candidate communities using a mechanism similar to information propagation very rapidly. Then, we merge small candidates that have fewer nodes than a calculated threshold with the larger ones using similarity between nodes and communities. Next, we engage a refinement operation on the candidates by moving all nodes to the candidates to which they are most similar using the same similarity index again. After that, we merge small communities with larger ones by using the similarity between communities until no gain in the modularity is obtained. Finally, in the last stage, we employ the same refinement operation as in the third stage. With an extensive experimentation on real-world and artificially-generated benchmark networks, we demonstrate and verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm scales very well with growing size and complexity of networks. Besides, our algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art community detection methods both in detection performance and computation time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3083971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9440929","Network community detection;network clustering;network science;network analysis;complex networks","Heuristic algorithms;Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Complex networks;Tools;Social networking (online);Partitioning algorithms","","7","","38","CCBY","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Site survey to build WiFi fingerprint library and fingerprint matching-based real-time positioning are based on WiFi indoor localization method two basic stages. Equipment heterogeneity and environmental dynamics are two main factors affecting indoor localization accuracy. In order to solve these problems, an algorithm based on Hierarchical Edit Distance(HED) function is proposed to realize calibrations-free fingerprint comparison of heterogeneous devices. RSSI information collected by different mobile devices is transformed into AP sequence. The hierarchical energy level of each AP is calculated according to the difference of the RSSI values. Then the distance between the WiFi fingerprints is calculated by edit distance. In order to locate WiFi fingerprint RSSI information, we use HED to obtain K neighbors, and use the WKNN algorithm to predict position. In order to verify robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm, five different mobile devices were used to collect WiFi RSSI information in three different types of indoor environments.

To reduce the amount of communication, the devices send quantized and compressed local decisions to the server, resulting in noisy global decisions. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between the optimization performance and the communication overhead. Existing works separately optimize computation and communication. In contrast, we jointly consider computation and communication over time, by encouraging temporal similarity in the decision sequence to control the communication overhead. We propose an efficient algorithm, termed Online Distributed Optimization with Temporal Similarity (ODOTS), where the local decisions are both computation- and communication-aware. Furthermore, ODOTS uses a novel tunable virtual queue, which completely removes the commonly assumed Slater’s condition through a modified Lyapunov drift analysis. ODOTS delivers provable performance bounds on both the optimization objective and constraint violation. As an example application, we apply ODOTS to enable communication-efficient federated learning. Our experimental results based on real-world image classification demonstrate that ODOTS obtains higher classification accuracy and lower communication overhead compared with the current best alternatives for both convex and non-convex loss functions.","2641-9874","979-8-3503-3414-2","10.1109/INFOCOM53939.2023.10229086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229086","","Performance evaluation;Costs;Federated learning;Computational efficiency;Servers;Noise measurement;Optimization","","","","50","IEEE","29 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the latter types can be viewed as improvements in many cases, most of the methods that have been proposed so far suffer in complexity, processing speed, and/or versatility when compared to their simpler pixel-based counterparts.

First, we align the class centers of the source and target domain by weighting the sample confidence to corresponding centers, to denoise the mislabeled samples. Second, we scatter the predictions of the target domain by minimizing the entropy of intra-class predictions and decreasing the similarity of inter-class distributions, which tackles the class overlap.

Finally, a negative-as-positive mechanism is constructed so as to stabilize the training process of DCGAN and reduce the harm caused by mode collapse. The algorithm is tested on TSP standard library instances and real-world instances. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can mitigate the problem of local convergence and achieve competitive performances over other GAN-based algorithms.","2831-7475","978-1-6654-9062-7","10.1109/ICPR56361.2022.9956322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9956322","generative adversarial networks;combinatorial optimization;evolutionary algorithm;local search","Training;Sociology;Evolutionary computation;Generative adversarial networks;Search problems;Hybrid power systems;Statistics","","","","31","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It implements a generate-and-test approach for on-line attack identification and uses similarity rules for generalization of attack signatures. We can immediately protect the system from many variants of previously unknown attacks without debilitating waits for anti-virus updates or software patches. Unique to our approach is the use of diverse process pairs not only for isolation benefits but also for detection. The architecture uses the comparison of outputs from diverse applications to provide a significant and novel intrusion detection capability. With this technique, we gain the benefits of n-version programming without its controversial disadvantages. The isolation of intrusions is mainly achieved with an out-of-band control system that separates the primary and backup system. It also initiates attack diagnosis and blocking, and recovery, which is accelerated by continual repair.","","0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174911","","Intrusion detection;Fault tolerant systems;Fault diagnosis;Fault tolerance;Hardware;Computer networks;Protection;Control systems;Data security;Error correction","","19","5","18","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Statistical power and a measure of sensitivity to the true location of the object are the criteria. Parameters are the numbers of 1's in object and image, subtemplate size, and parameters reflecting intensity distortion between template and object. One of the proposed statistics R is much more computationally intensive than the other G. Although R is more powerful than G and the other statistics, G is generally more sensitive to the true object location. Statistic G is also more powerful than the sum of absolute differences and correlation. All statistics are robust to incomplete knowledge of distortion parameters.

Such a reconstruction can be obtained from motion data by comparing the trajectory segments and estimating both the spatial and temporal alignments. Exhaustive testing of all possible correspondences of trajectories over a temporal window is only viable in the cases with a limited number of moving targets and large view overlaps. Therefore, alternative solutions are required for situations with several trajectories that are only partially visible in each view. In this paper, we propose a new method that is based on view-invariant representation of trajectories, which is used to produce a sparse set of salient points for trajectory segments observed in each view. Only the neighborhoods at these salient points in the view-invariant representation are then used to estimate the spatial and temporal alignment of trajectory pairs in different views. It is demonstrated that, for planar scenes, the method is able to recover with good precision and efficiency both spatial and temporal alignments, even given relatively small overlap between views and arbitrary (unknown) temporal shifts of the cameras. The method also provides the same capabilities in the case of trajectories that are only locally planar, but exhibit some nonplanarity at a global level.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4775905","Registration;invariants;similarity measures;cross ratio.","Video sequences;Cameras;Trajectory;Layout;Geometry;Motion estimation;Testing;Surveillance;Computer vision;Software","","6","","27","IEEE","6 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the way BigCloneBench has been constructed makes it problematic to use as ground truth for learning code similarity. This paper highlights the features of BigCloneBench that affect the ground truth quality and discusses common misperceptions about the benchmark. For example, extending or replacing the ground truth without understanding the properties of BigCloneBench often leads to wrong assumptions which can lead to invalid results. Also, a manual investigation of a sample of Weak-Type-3/Type-4 clone pairs revealed 86% of pairs to be false positives, threatening the results of machine learning approaches using BigCloneBench.

This scheduling is complicated and involves various factors; thus, the shop scheduling problem of a PCB prototyping assembly is regarded as a multiobjective permutation flow shop scheduling problem (MOPFSP). A mathematical model with four objective functions is built based on the characteristics of a PCB prototyping assembly shop. In this article an aggregation-based approach is designed to aggregate multiple objective function values into the similarity of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (sIFSs). This approach is adopted as a fitness function assignment strategy and is combined with the optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) to build a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm: the OFA based on sIFSs (OFA-sIFSs). To verify the performance of OFA-sIFSs, six congress on evolutionary computation benchmark test functions, ten MOPFSP benchmark instances and a practical problem for a PCB prototyping assembly are solved by OFA-sIFSs and three state-of-the-art algorithms. Three types of similarity measures are evaluated. During the process of testing, four performance metrics, statistical analysis, and business software are employed. The results of this study suggest that OFA-sIFSs can be used to solve the MOPFSP and have better performances compared with the other three algorithms.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2020.2985333","Intelligent Manufacturing Integrated Standardization; New Model Application Project in 2016 of MIIT(grant numbers:(2016) 213); Program of Fuzhou Science and Technology Bureau(grant numbers:2017-G-71); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057375","Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs);multiobjective optimization;multiobjective permutation flow shop scheduling problem (MOPFSP);optimal foraging algorithm (OFA);printed circuit board (PCB) prototyping assembly","Fuzzy sets;Optimization;Job shop scheduling;Linear programming;Mathematical model;Software algorithms","","8","","37","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we develop a predictive Lagrange multiplier estimation method to resolve the chicken and egg dilemma of perceptual-based RDO and apply it to H.264 intra and inter mode decision. Given a perceptual quality level, the resulting video encoder achieves on the average 9% bit-rate reduction for intra-frame coding and 11% for inter-frame coding over the JM reference software. Subjective test further confirms that, at the same bit-rate, the proposed perceptual RDO indeed preserves image details and prevents block artifact better than traditional RDO.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2087472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5604279","H.264;lagrange multiplier;perceptual quality;rate-distortion optimization;structural similarity index;video codec","Indexes;Measurement;Encoding;Estimation;Approximation methods;Video coding;Fitting","","101","3","28","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For most related learning methods, there is a basic assumption that training data should be in identical structure, which does not hold in many situations in practice. In order to learn from training data in different structures, we propose a similarity-based Bayesian learning approach for fault diagnosis in this paper. Our method is to first estimate similarity degrees of structural elements from different log files. Then the basic structure of combined Bayesian network (CBN) is constructed, and the similarity-based learning algorithm is used to compute probabilities in CBN. Finally, test log data can be classified into possible fault categories based on the generated CBN.

We propose a new static analysis called CARDINAL that is tolerant of the differences in binaries introduced by compiling the same source code with different flags or with different compilers. We accomplished this goal by finding an invariant between these differences. The effective invariant we found is the number of arguments to a call, or call parameter cardinality (CPC). We concatenate all CPC's together per function and input these chains into a Bloom filter. Signatures constructed in this manner can be quickly compared to each other using a Jaccard index to obtain a similarity score. We empirically tested our algorithm on a large corpus of transformed programs and found that using a threshold value of 0.15 for determining a positive or negative match yielded results with a 11% false negative rate and a 11% false positive rate. Overall, we both demonstrate that CPC's are a telling feature that can increase the efficacy of static malware analyses and point the way forward in static analyses.","","978-1-5090-4542-6","10.1109/MALWARE.2016.7888728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888728","Distribution A;Approved for public release;distribution unlimited.","Registers;Malware;Context;Algorithm design and analysis;Optimization;Indexes","","","","14","IEEE","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transmission from devices located deep within buildings or in remote neighborhoods will suffer severe attenuation forcing the use of slow data-rates to reach even the closest gateway, thus resulting in battery drain. This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances both the battery life of client devices and the coverage of LPWANs in large urban deployments. Charm allows multiple LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently combining them to detect weak signals that are not decodable at any individual gateway. Through a novel hardware and software design at the gateway, Charm carefully detects which chunks of the received signal need to be sent to the cloud, thereby saving uplink bandwidth. We present a scalable solution to decoding weak transmissions at city-scale by identifying the set of gateways whose signals need to be coherently combined over time. In evaluations over a test network and from simulations using traces from a large LoRaWAN deployment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charm demonstrates a gain of up to 3x in range and 4x in client battery-life.","","978-1-5386-5298-5","10.1109/IPSN.2018.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8480036","LPWAN;sensor networks;coherent combining;diversity","Logic gates;Cloud computing;Diversity reception;Batteries;Hardware;MIMO communication;Urban areas","","92","","35","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This strategy uses dynamic K-Distance pruning to minimize the total number of shared edges between nodes with similar platforms while retaining access to mission-critical services.

In order to benefit a domain of applications, a domain platform exploration tool must take advantage of structural and functional similarities across applications by allocating a common set of ACCs. A previous approach [1] proposed a GenetIc Domain Exploration tool (GIDE) that applied a restrictive binding algorithm that mapped applications functions to monolithic accelerators. This approach suffered from lower average application throughput across and reduced platform generality. This paper introduces a Multi-Granularity based Domain Design Space Exploration tool (MG-DmDSE) to improve both average application throughput as well as platform generality. The key contributions of MG-DmDSE are: (1) Applying a multi-granular decomposition of coarse grain application functions into more granular compute kernels. (2) Examining compute similarity between functions in order to produce more generic functions. (3) Configuring monolithic ACCs by selectively bypassing compute elements within them during DSE to expose more functionality. To assess MG-DmDSE, both GIDE and MG-DmDSE were applied to applications in the OpenVX library. MG-DmDSE achieves an average 2.84x greater application throughput compared to GIDE. Additionally, 87.5% of applications benefited from running on the platform produced by MG-DmDSE vs 50% from GIDE, which indicated increase platform generality.","1558-1101","978-3-9819263-5-4","10.23919/DATE51398.2021.9474196","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1319501); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474196","","Visual analytics;Tools;Throughput;Genetics;Libraries;Space exploration;Kernel","","","","13","","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to the conventional hashing methods using handcrafted features, emerging deep hashing approaches employ deep neural networks to learn both feature representations and hash functions, which have been proven to be more powerful and robust in real-world applications. Currently, most of the existing deep hashing methods construct pairwise or triplet-wise constraints to obtain similar binary codes between a pair of similar data points or relatively similar binary codes within a triplet. However, we argue that some critical local structures have not been fully exploited. So, this paper proposes a novel deep hashing method named local semantic-aware deep hashing with Hamming-isometric quantization (LSDH), aiming to make full use of local similarity in hash function learning. Specifically, the potential semantic relation is exploited to robustly preserve local similarity of data in the Hamming space. In addition to reducing the error introduced by binary quantizing, a Hamming-isometric objective is designed to maximize the consistency of similarity between the pairwise binary-like features and corresponding binary codes pair, which is shown to be able to improve the quality of binary codes. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets, including three single-label datasets and one multi-label dataset, demonstrate that the proposed LSDH achieves better performance than the latest state-of-the-art hashing methods.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2018.2889269","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836217,61427811,61573360); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0821602,2016YFB1001000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585128","Image retrieval;deep hashing;similarity-preserving;local structures;Hamming-isometric","Binary codes;Quantization (signal);Image retrieval;Semantics;Benchmark testing;Automation","","15","","70","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The computations in such applications usually exhibit superior value locality, i.e., computations performed by a function or code region are very likely to produce “similar” results. Reusing such similar results can bypass redundant computations, as long as “exact” results are not mandatory. However, conventional computation reuse techniques are less effective in approximate computing paradigm. The input values of two computations have to be identical to reuse one for another, hence “exact” in nature. We propose ACR, an approximate computation reuse scheme, to enable computation reuse for approximate computing. ACR relaxes the exact matching requirement in inputs to some extent regulated by “similarity” quantification, thereby shifting the exact computation reuse paradigm to its approximate counterpart. Specifically, using statistical approaches ACR first provides an input significance-aware similarity quantification scheme to calculate similarity between different computations. ACR also provides a regression based branch prediction technique to resolve conditional branches inside a computation. Furthermore, on top of proposed approximate computing framework, ACR presents a parallel implementation of computing engine to carry out branch resolving and similar computation searching. Experimental results show that the ACR scheme could effectively exploit the potential of computation reuse for approximate computing and achieves 3.12 times speedup on average for a set of approximate benchmarks.","2332-7766","","10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2617343","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61522406,61572470,61532017,61432017,61376043,61221062,61521092); Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS(grant numbers:Y404441000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7589994","Approximate computing;computation reuse;similarity quantification;content addressable memory;regression techniques","Approximate computing;Computational modeling;Impedance matching;History;Engines;Benchmark testing;Associative memory","","14","","41","IEEE","13 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure for protein structure comparisons using a set of multi-view 2D images of 3D protein structures. In this approach, each protein structure is represented by a subspace from the image set. The similarity between two protein structures is then characterized by the canonical angles between the two subspaces. The primary advantage of our method is that precise alignment is not needed. We employed Grassmann Discriminant Analysis (GDA) as the subspace-based learning in the classification framework. We applied our method for the classification problem of seven SCOP structural classes of protein 3D structures. The proposed method outperformed the k-nearest neighbor method (k-NN) based on conventional alignment-based methods CE, FATCAT, and TM-align.

Shallow marine systems, particularly coral reefs, are under significant pressures due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other anthropogenic pressures, leading to rapid, often devastating changes, in these fragile and diverse ecosystems. Historically, remote sensing of shallow marine habitats has been limited to meter-scale imagery due to the optical effects of ocean wave distortion, refraction, and optical attenuation. NeMO-Net combines 3D cm-scale distortion-free imagery captured using NASA's airborne FluidCam and fluid lensing remote sensing technology with low resolution airborne and spaceborne datasets of varying spatial resolutions, spectral spaces, calibrations, and temporal cadence in a supercomputer-based deep learning framework. NeMO-Net augments and improves the benthic habitat classification accuracy of low-resolution datasets across large geographic and temporal scales using high-resolution training data from FluidCam.

(1993) reported on the design of a wide area diversity Ka-band VSAT network that has been extensively simulated in software as well as having been constructed and tested using an innovative hardware fade simulator that enables the behaviour of the system under reproducible propagation conditions to be examined. The present paper reports on the performance of the system using both simulated results as well as those taken from a hardware fade simulator. It shows that spatial diversity techniques, when used in conjunction with data networks, can provide Ka band users with significant improvements in service, particularly when reliability and availability are of importance.<>","","0-85296-635-0","10.1049/cp:19950007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=471815","","Data communication;Diversity methods;Metropolitan area networks;Microwave propagation;Satellite communication","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

As a regional industrial park, many enterprises are faced with the opportunity of transformation. Because of their small scale, these enterprises are short of manufacturing resources, professional talents and knowledge. The emergence of manufacturing service platform can integrate resources from different channels, provide enterprises with services such as production, design and intellectual support, and improve manufacturing efficiency. Based on a brief analysis of the connotation of knowledge fusion and transformation in complex problem solving and the demand for collaborative innovation, this paper proposes a metaphor cognitive strategy and cognitive method of multiple integration according to its characteristics, and designs a data modeling method based on intelligent guidance and multiple theory. Based on the traffic intelligent guidance system, this paper uses Proteus Software to simulate and test some modules, including data acquisition module, time display module and indicator module, and uses electronic components and related materials to make each module and model.","","978-1-6654-0360-3","10.1109/ICCMC51019.2021.9418337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418337","Sustainability;Intelligent Guidance;Multi Theory;Data Modeling;CAN Bus Design","Technological innovation;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Production;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","","","22","IEEE","6 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
