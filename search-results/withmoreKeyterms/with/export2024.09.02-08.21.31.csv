We combine software pre-processing and architecture customization to fully expose and exploit the underlying heterogeneity in the factorization algorithm. We perform a one-time pre-processing of the sparse matrices in software to generate dataflow graphs that capture raw parallelism in the computation through substitution and reassociation transformations. We customize the dataflow architecture by picking the right mixture of addition and multiplication processing elements to match the observed balance in the dataflow graphs. Additionally, we modify the network-onchip to route certain critical dependencies on a separate, faster communication channel while relegating less-critical traffic to the existing channels. Using our techniques, we show how to achieve speedups of up to 37% over existing state-of-the-art FPGA-based sparse LU factorization systems that can already run 3–4× faster than CPU-based sparse LU solvers using the same hardware constraints.","1946-1488","978-3-00-044645-0","10.1109/FPL.2014.6927401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927401","","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Sparse matrices;Hardware;Parallel processing;Optimization","","2","2","4","","20 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method can achieve higher classification rates than the standard SVM due to the sparser support vectors.

Nontrivial GAPs evolve through many versions, and understanding how GUIs of different versions of GAPs differ is crucial for various software quality tasks such as testing, cross-platform UI comparison and project effort estimation. Yet despite the criticality of automating GUI differencing, it is a manual, tedious, and laborious task. We offer a novel approach for differencing GUIs that combines tree edit distance measure algorithms with accessibility technologies for obtaining GUI models in a non-intrusive, platform and language-independent way, and it does not require the source code of GAPs. We developed a tool called GUI DifferEntiator (GUIDE) that allows users to difference GUIs of running GAPs. To evaluate GUIDE, we created an experimental platform that generates random GUIs with controlled differentials among them that serve as oracles. GUIDE enables researchers to plug-and-play various GUI differencing algorithms and to automatically run experiments. We evaluated GUIDE on 5,000 pairs of generated complex GUIs and three open-source GAPs and the results of our evaluation suggest that GUIDE can find differences between GUIs with a high degree of automation and precision.","","978-1-5386-7757-5","10.1109/QRS.2018.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424972","differencing, GUI, tree-edit, algorithms, accessibility, testing, similarity, generator, comparison","Graphical user interfaces;Testing;Task analysis;Microsoft Windows;Estimation;Computational modeling;Libraries","","3","1","61","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It generally consists in grouping similar reports through clustering techniques. However, with real-time streaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question: What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently, we study in this paper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the most relevant metrics used in the literature, we introduce DeepLsh, a Siamese DNN architecture with an original loss function, that perfectly approximates the locality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for which exact LSH solutions exist.

Instead of using the sparse normalizer in existing sparse subspace clustering methods, a quadratic normalizer for the data sparse representation is adopted to model the correlation among the data sparse coefficients. Additionally, a block-diagonal prior for the spectral clustering affinity matrix is integrated with the model to improve clustering accuracy. To solve the proposed BD-OSC model, which is a complex optimization problem with quadratic normalizer and block-diagonal prior constraint, an efficient algorithm is proposed.

Each unit in the system forms a private opinion on the status of each of its neighboring units based on duplication of jobs and comparison of job results over time. A diagnosis algorithm that consists of simply taking a majority vote among the neighbors of a unit to determine the status of that unit is then executed. The performance of this simple majority-vote diagnosis algorithm is analyzed using a probabilistic model for the faults in the system. It is shown that with high probability, for systems composed of n units, the algorithm will correctly identify the status of all units when each unit is connected to O(log n) other units. It is also shown that the algorithm works with high probability in a class of systems in which the average number of neighbors of a unit is constant. The results indicate that fault diagnosis can in fact be achieved quite simply in multiprocessor systems containing a low to moderate number of testing conditions.<>","","0-8186-1959-7","10.1109/FTCS.1989.105544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=105544","","Fault diagnosis;Multiprocessing systems;Circuit faults;System testing;Computer science;Voting;Hypercubes;Application software;Algorithm design and analysis;Large-scale systems","","23","1","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of the highest integrity level functionalities (e.g. ASIL-D in automotive), diverse redundancy must be deployed to avoid unreasonable risk of a single fault leading the system to a failure (e.g. using lockstepped cores). However, existing lockstep solutions are either (1) highly intrusive and inflexible coupling two cores with hardware means, or (2) costly in terms of execution time and monitoring if a software monitor thread checks that cores running redundantly preserve sufficient staggering. This paper presents SafeDE, a Diversity Enforcement hardware module providing light-lockstep support by means of a non-intrusive and flexible hardware module that preserves staggering across cores running redundant threads, thus bringing time diversity. SafeDE reconciles the lightness and flexibility of software-only solutions, even allowing using the cores without any lockstepping, as well as the tighter staggering of hardware-only solutions that allow using staggering values of few cycles, instead of hundreds of microseconds, as for software-only solutions. Our integration of SafeDE in a RISC-V FPGA-based space multicore from Cobham Gaisler shows that staggering is effectively preserved, and SafeDE overheads are negligible in terms of area and performance due to staggering.","1942-9401","978-1-6654-3370-9","10.1109/IOLTS52814.2021.9486715","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(grant numbers:PID2019-107255GB); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486715","","Multicore processing;Redundancy;Aerospace electronics;Hardware;Software;Safety;Task analysis","","7","","39","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we apply diversification on the interfaces of IoT operating systems. To this aim, we introduce the diversification in post-compilation and linking phase of the software life-cycle, by shuffling the order of the linked objects while preserving the semantics of the code. This approach successfully prevents malicious exploits from producing adverse effects in the system. Besides shuffling, we also apply library symbol diversification method, and construct needed support for it e.g. into the dynamic loading phase. Besides studying and discussing memory layout shuffling and symbol diversification as a security measures for IoT operating systems, we provide practical implementations for these schemes for Thingsee OS and Raspbian operating systems and test these solutions to show the feasibility of diversification in IoT environments.","","978-1-4503-4616-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881649","software security;diversi cation;IoT","","","","","23","","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though the notion of data similarity is naturally suited to many applications in the process control industry, its adoption is hampered by the lack of an easy interface to COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) components. We report our ongoing work in incorporating the idea of data similarity into embedded applications, especially in the process control industry. Our approach is to allow designers to specify similarity predicates by means of an SQL-like interface to the client applications. Query processing is performed by a compact firm-real-time database engine called SRDE (Similarity-based Real-time Database Engine). SRDE is object oriented and is designed to manage real-time data efficiently in a distributed environment. By exploiting data similarity, SRDE can be used to minimize data traffic according to the client's specifications. SRDE has been implemented in 100% JAVA that supports JDBC API. We demonstrate the use of SRDE in a typical industrial control application.","1052-8725","0-7695-0475-2","10.1109/REAL.1999.818835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=818835","","Process control;Application software;Engines;Environmental management;Java;Transaction databases;Hardware;Query processing;Testing;Industrial control","","5","1","31","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses how the balance between these two extremes is achieved as part of the ground segment and flight segment that will support the eight microsatellites of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission. The NASA CYGNSS mission aims to understand the coupling between ocean surface properties, moist atmospheric thermodynamics, radiation, and convective dynamics in the inner core of Tropical Cyclones (TCs). The mission is comprised of eight microsatellites in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at an inclination of 35 degrees. As discussed in “The CYGNSS Ground Segment: Innovative Missions Operations Concepts to Support a Micro-Satellite Constellation” [1], previously presented at IEEE Aerospace 2013, the ground segment system must take into account the unique aspects of each microsatellite, including unique Spacecraft Identification (SCID) schemes, setup of multiple ground system consoles, definition of telemetry limits unique to a microsatellite, and any unique table or command loads. This paper expands upon the previously presented paper on the ground segment, and discusses how each of these details has been addressed in the implementation of the CYGNSS mission. This includes discussion of how Spacecraft I/Ds are defined onboard via the avionics, how the FSW table configurations vary between microsatellites, and whether or not a “one-size-fits-all” approach of FSW images is necessary for each microsatellite.

The latter leads to a waste of resources as the computation is also performed on zero's operands which do not contribute to the final result. This paper designs a novel graph processing accelerator, SparseMEM, targeting sparse datasets by leveraging the computing-in-memory (CIM) concept; CIM is a promising solution to alleviate the overhead of data movement and the inherent poor locality of graph processing. The proposed solution stores the graph information in a compressed hierarchical format inside the memory and adjusts the workflow based on this new mapping. This vastly improves resource utilization, leading to higher energy and permanence efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that SparseMEM outperforms a GPU-based platform and two state-of-the-art in-memory accelerators on speedup and energy efficiency by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively.","1558-1101","979-8-3503-9624-9","10.23919/DATE56975.2023.10137303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137303","in-memory;memristor;graph;sparsity","Performance evaluation;Memory management;Memristors;Energy efficiency;Common Information Model (computing);Computational efficiency;Resource management","","3","","21","","2 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Demand-driven pointer analysis seeks to be efficient by computing information only for variables on which a demand is raised, through a points-to or alias query. Yet, research has shown that when applied to large-scale programs even demand-driven analyses can become expensive in terms of memory and runtime. This paper thus investigates to what extent demand-driven pointer analysis can be accelerated further if being executed over a sparse control-flow graph (CFG), specialized to those queries. We investigate two designs: First, typeaware sparsification, in which the resulting CFG only consists of statements containing variables that are type compatible with the query variable. Second, alias-aware sparsification, where the resulting CFG consists of the def-use chains of the query variable and all its intra-procedural aliases.We implement both designs in SparseBoomerang by extending Boomerang, a pointer analysis framework based on push-down systems. We evaluate SparseBoomerang by comparing it to Boomerang in terms of precision and performance. On the Pointerbench micro-benchmark suite for alias analysis, SparseBoomerang maintains the precision of Boomerang, in both designs. We evaluate the runtime and memory performance of SparseBoomerang by using Flowdroid as a taint analysis client on real-world apps. Compared to the baseline Boomerang, on average SparseBoomerang solves alias queries 2.4x faster when using the type-aware sparsification strategy, and 2.8x faster when using the alias-aware variant with negligible memory overhead.","2159-4848","978-1-6654-5666-1","10.1109/ICST57152.2023.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10132184","sparse pointer analysis;demand-driven analysis;data-flow analysis","Software testing;Runtime;Life estimation","","2","","40","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The changes caused by ASD are associated with different age and sex-related patterns in neuroimaging data. However, most contemporary computer-assisted ASD diagnosis methods ignore the aforementioned age-/sexrelated patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse multiview task-centralized (Sparse-MVTC) ensemble classification method for image-based ASD diagnosis. Specifically, with the age and sex information of each subject, we formulate the classification as a multitask learning problem, where each task corresponds to learning upon a specific age/sex group. We also extract multiview features per subject to better reveal the FC changes. Then, in Sparse-MVTC learning, we select a certain central task and treat the rest as auxiliary tasks. By considering both task-task and view-view relationships between the central task and each auxiliary task, we can learn better upon the entire dataset. Finally, by selecting the central task, in turn, we are able to derive multiple classifiers for each task/group. An ensemble strategy is further adopted, such that the final diagnosis can be integrated for each subject. Our comprehensive experiments on the ABIDE database demonstrate that our proposed Sparse-MVTC ensemble learning can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art classification methods for ASD diagnosis.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2018.2839693","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:1U01MH110274,EB006733,MH100217,AG041721); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61300151,81471733,61473190,61702225); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2017YFC0107602); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:16410722400,16511101100); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20151299,BK20151358,BK20160187,BK20161268); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8388295","ABIDE;autism spectrum disorder (ASD);diagnosis;high-order functional connectivity (FC);machine learning;multiview multitask (MVMT) learning;sparse multiview task-centralized (Sparse-MVTC) learning","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Correlation;Media;Learning systems;Radiology;Data mining","Adolescent;Adult;Autism Spectrum Disorder;Brain;Child;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Nerve Net;Neuroimaging;Young Adult","51","","49","IEEE","19 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is true even when techniques make use of heuristic search strategies, like genetic programming, that in principle support the construction of patches of arbitrary length. One key reason is that the fitness function traditionally depends entirely on test cases, which are poor at identifying partially correct solutions and lead to a fitness landscape with many plateaus. We propose a novel fitness function that optimizes for both functionality and semantic diversity, characterized using learned invariants over intermediate behavior.

In this paper, we present a case study on how much context diversity for test cases relates to fault-based mutants in pervasive software. Our empirical results show that conventional mutation operators can generate sufficient candidate mutants to support test effectiveness evaluation of pervasive software, and test cases with higher context diversity values tend to have higher mean mutation scores. On the other hand, for test cases sharing the same context diversity, their mutation scores can vary significantly in terms of standard derivations.","2332-662X","978-0-7695-4131-0","10.1109/QSIC.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562954","context diversity;mutation analysis;pervasive computing","Context;Software;Middleware;Testing;Measurement;Java;Radiofrequency identification","","5","","36","IEEE","7 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Zernike moments of a given shape are calculated as correlation values of the shape with Zernike basis functions in that all the pixels of the shape regardless of their positions contribute with the same weight to the Zernike moments. The proposed modified Zernike moment descriptor for a shape is obtained taking account of the importance of the outer form of the shape to human perception. The modified Zernike moment descriptor is obtained by first dividing the original shape into two parts of inner and outer regions with a predetermined radius and then calculating the Zernike moment of the outer part and the inner part of the shape. The proposed descriptor consists of Zernike moments of outer and inner parts. Euclidean distance is used for computing the distance measure between two shapes. For perceptual similarity-based retrieval, the Zernike moments of the outer part are used and for exact-matching retrieval, both of the outer and inner Zernike moments are used. Experimentation under various test conditions shows the effectiveness of the proposed modified Zernike moment descriptor.","","0-7803-6536-4","10.1109/ICME.2000.869602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869602","","Shape measurement;Humans;Image retrieval;Trademarks;Euclidean distance;Testing;Mobile communication;Electronics industry;Content based retrieval;Focusing","","9","","5","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when this same model is applied to a forest stand whose parameters are slightly off the modeled age curve, then the inversion fails. This paper describes the authors' efforts to develop an inversion technique for Loblolly pine stands with the natural diversity of their canopy parameters accounted for. Given a set of Loblolly pine stands from the Duke forest a set of parameters that sufficiently model the stands using MIMICS (Ulaby, et al., 1988) were developed. Next, several important parameters were chosen to be varied over a specified interval with a Gaussian distribution to allow for natural variation. This generated a large data set of 1000 different Loblolly pine canopies. MIMICS was then employed to generate the expected radar backscatter from this set at P, L, and C bands. This data, was then used to train two artificial neural networks: one to invert for the average trunk diameter and subsequently another to invert for the large branch density. This cascaded approach worked well giving errors of only a few percent for trunk diameters and 5% for branch density, when using data with trunk diameters varying between 1 cm and 10 cm. Beyond 10 cm the radar signal begins to saturate due to the high biomass, and was not invertible.<>","","0-7803-1240-6","10.1109/IGARSS.1993.322318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=322318","","Artificial neural networks;Intelligent networks;Neural networks;Radar polarimetry;Backscatter;Biomass;Radar imaging;Training data;Testing;Software measurement","","2","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce the costly computational and memory requirements of these workloads, various efficient sparsification approaches have been introduced, resulting in widespread sparsity across different types of DNN models. In this context, there is an emerging need for scheduling sparse multi-DNN workloads, a problem that is largely unexplored in previous literature. This paper systematically analyses the use-cases of multiple sparse DNNs and investigates the opportunities for optimizations. Based on these findings, we propose Dysta, a novel bi-level dynamic and static scheduler that utilizes both static sparsity patterns and dynamic sparsity information for the sparse multi-DNN scheduling. Both static and dynamic components of Dysta are jointly designed at the software and hardware levels, respectively, to improve and refine the scheduling approach. To facilitate future progress in the study of this class of workloads, we construct a public benchmark that contains sparse multi-DNN workloads across different deployment scenarios, spanning from mobile phones and AR/VR wearables to data centers. A comprehensive evaluation on the sparse multi-DNN benchmark demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with up to 10% decrease in latency constraint violation rate and nearly 4 × reduction in average normalized turnaround time.

The sparse dictionary consists of two parts: basic dictionary and atom representation matrix. The sparse dictionary leads to compact representation and it is both adaptive and efficient. Furthermore, compared with conventional SR methods, two dictionary pairs, i.e. primitive sparse dictionary pair and residual sparse dictionary pair, are proposed. The primitive sparse dictionary pair is learned to reconstruct initial high-resolution (HR) remote sensing image from a single low-resolution (LR) input. However, the initial HR remote sensing image loses some details compare with the corresponding original HR image completely. Therefore, residual sparse dictionary pair is learned to reconstruct residual information.

However, existing methods often struggle to achieve both high precision and efficiency. This paper presents a high-precision memory vulnerability detection approach based on value flow analysis and parallel computing. We first construct a static semantic representation called SVFG to enable precise detection of memory vulnerabilities such as null pointer dereference and use-after-free. We then perform dependency-aware path feasibility analysis using an SMT solver to reduce false positives. Finally, we develop a task-level parallel framework to accelerate the constraint solving process and improve efficiency.We evaluate our approach on the Juliet test set of over 2,000 test cases and 7 open-source projects. Experimental results show that our dependency-aware analysis can achieve 0.5%-2.05% false positive rates, outperforming traditional approaches and existing tools. Our task-level parallel framework can achieve up to 3.25x speedup with 4 computing nodes.Our study demonstrates that combining value flow analysis and parallel computing is a promising way to enable highly precise and efficient detection of memory vulnerabilities. For future work, we plan to integrate pointer analysis to support more complex codes, and optimize the granularity of parallelism to improve scalability.

This paper proposes a new method to overcome the above limitations by introducing internal state observations at the boundary of chip that can be viewed by probing these pins. The proposed method consists of routing hardware observability signal from every individual IP to pins, which are controlled by means of boot-pins on the chip. The solution accomplishes the same with no additional overhead in terms of pin count and helps to debug DoA silicon.

As the number of objectives increases, the number of mutually nondominated solutions explodes and MOEAs become invalid due to the loss of Pareto-based selection pressure. Indicator-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been proposed to address this issue by enhancing the environmental selection. Indicator-based MaOEAs are easy to implement and of good versatility, however, they are unlikely to maintain the population diversity and coverage very well. In this article, a new indicator-based MaOEA with boundary protection, namely, MaOEA-IBP, is presented to relieve this weakness. In MaOEA-IBP, a worst elimination mechanism based on the  ${I}_{{\epsilon }^{+}}$  indicator and boundary protection strategy is devised to enhance the balance of population convergence, diversity, and coverage. Specifically, a pair of solutions with the smallest  ${I}_{{\epsilon }^{+}}$  value are first identified from the population. If one solution dominates the other, the dominated solution is eliminated. Otherwise, one solution is eliminated by the boundary protection strategy. MaOEA-IBP is compared with four indicator-based algorithms (i.e.,  ${I}_{{{ {SDE}}}^{+}}$ , SRA, MaOEAIGD, and ARMOEA) and other five state-of-the-art MaOEAs (i.e., KnEA, MaOEA-CSS, 1by1EA, RVEA, and EFR-RR) on various benchmark MaOPs. The experimental results demonstrate that MaOEA-IBP can achieve competitive performance with the compared algorithms.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2960302","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871272,61471246,61976143,61672358); Project of Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2016KTSCX121); Scientific Research Foundation of Shenzhen University for newly introduced teachers(grant numbers:2019048); Zhejiang Lab’s International Talent Fund for Young Professionals; Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20170302154227954,JCGG20170414111229388,JCYJ20170302154328155); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957257","Iϵ⁺ indicator;boundary protection;convergence;coverage;diversity;evolutionary algorithm;many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA);multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA)","Sociology;Statistics;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Diversity reception;Optimization;Computational complexity","","52","","70","IEEE","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a model-driven method, Flyover, to generate a dataset of diverse interchanges with measurable diversity coverage. First, Flyover uses a labeled digraph to model interchange topology. Second, Flyover takes real-world interchanges as input to guarantee topology practicality and extracts different topology equivalence classes by classifying corresponding topology models. Third, for each topology class, Flyover identifies the corresponding geometrical features for the ramps and generates concrete interchanges using k-way combinatorial coverage and differential evolution. To illustrate the diversity and applicability of the generated interchange dataset, we test the built-in traffic flow control algorithm in SUMO and the fuel-optimization trajectory tracking algorithm deployed to Alibaba's autonomous trucks on the dataset. The results show that except for the geometrical difference, the interchanges are diverse in throughput and fuel consumption under the traffic flow control and trajectory tracking algorithms, respectively.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160868","Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160868","","Road transportation;Trajectory tracking;Roads;Urban areas;Feature extraction;Throughput;Topology","","3","","24","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More specifically, by treating the DNN as a program and each neuron as a functional point of the code, during the network training we aim to improve the generalization capability by maximizing the neuron coverage of DNN with the gradient similarity regularization between the original and augmented samples. As such, the decision behavior of the DNN is optimized, avoiding the arbitrary neurons that are deleterious for the unseen samples, and leading to the trained DNN that can be better generalized to out-of-distribution samples. Extensive studies on various domain generalization tasks based on both single and multiple domain(s) setting demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.

A recent research validates the possibility to combine multiple proprietary migration services offered by different vendors together to complete cloud migration. Pattern based service composition has been proven as an appealing approach to accelerate the service composition and ensure the qualities in the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) domain and can be applied to the cloud migration service composition theoretically. However, current pattern generation approaches are not applicable for the cloud migration due to lack of either existing cloud migration business process knowledge or execution logs. This paper proposes a novel approach to generate cloud migration patterns from a set of service composition solutions.

In some real-world applications, however, the training data (coming from the source domain) and test data (from the target domain) come from different domains or time periods, and this may result in the different distributions of some features. Moreover, the values of the features and/or labels of the datasets might be nonnumeric and involve vague values. Traditional learning-based prediction and classification methods cannot handle these two issues. In this study, we propose a multistep fuzzy bridged refinement domain adaptation algorithm, which offers an effective way to deal with both issues. It utilizes a concept of similarity to modify the labels of the target instances that were initially predicted by a shift-unaware model. It then refines the labels using instances that are most similar to a given target instance. These instances are extracted from mixture domains composed of source and target domains. The proposed algorithm is built on a basis of some data and refines the labels, thus performing completely independently of the shift-unaware prediction model. The algorithm uses a fuzzy set-based approach to deal with the vague values of the features and labels. Four different datasets are used in the experiments to validate the proposed algorithm. The results, which are compared with those generated by the existing domain adaptation methods, demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy in both the above-mentioned datasets.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2387872","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP 140101366,DP110103733); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001634","Classification;Domain Adaptation;Fuzzy set-based Approach;Fuzzy similarity;Transfer Learning;Classification;domain adaptation;fuzzy set-based approach;fuzzy similarity;transfer learning","Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Learning systems;Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Data models;Classification algorithms","","34","","37","IEEE","6 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, a novel approach for enhancing the sparsity of the solution is proposed. It consists of a two-step processing in which the NMD is solved joining a ℓ2 regularization and a threshold filtering. In the first step, the NMD is performed with the ℓ2 regularization in order to get an overall selection of the notes most likely appearing in the monotimbral musical excerpt. In the second step, a threshold filtering followed by another ℓ2 regularized NMD are repeatedly performed in order to progressively reduce the dictionary matrix and to refine the notes transcription. Furthermore, a user-oriented instrument learning procedure has been conceived and proposed. The proposed AMT system has been tested upon the dataset collected by the LabROSA laboratories considering the transcription of three different pianos. Moreover, it has been validated through a comparison with a regularized NMD and with three open source AMT software. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed two-step processing in enhancing the sparsity of the solution and in improving the transcription accuracy.

Previous research has explored design diversity, data diversity, and duplication techniques to detect such faults in other safety-critical domains. However, these are challenging to use for AVs in practice due to significant resource overhead and design complexity. We propose, DiverseAV, a low-cost data-diversity-based redundancy technique for detecting safety-critical random hardware faults in computational elements. DiverseAV introduces data-diversity between the redundant agents by exploiting the temporal semantic consistency available in the AV sensor data. DiverseAV is a black-box technique that offers a plug-and-play solution as it requires no knowledge of the internals of the AI agent responsible for executing driving decisions, requiring little to no modification to the agent itself for achieving high coverage of transient and permanent hardware faults. It is commercially viable because it avoids software modifications to agents that are costly in terms of development and testing time. Specifically, DiverseAV distributes the sensor data between the two software agents in a round-robin manner. As a result, the sensor data for two consecutive time steps are semantically similar in terms of their worldview but significantly different at the bit level, thus ensuring the state and data diversity between the two agents necessary for detecting faults. We demonstrate DiverseAV using an open-source self-driving AI agent which is controlling a car in an open-source world simulator.","2158-3927","978-1-6654-1693-1","10.1109/DSN53405.2022.00021","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833576","","Redundancy;Vehicle safety;Semantics;Hardware;Software agents;Complexity theory;Artificial intelligence","","6","","70","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tests require students to give brief theoretical responses to the questions. Evaluation of subjective responses is based on the presence of certain facts, keywords, phrases that need to be mentioned. Traditional assessment of these tests requires an examiner to affirm the understanding of concepts by students through their answers. The human-dependant evaluation, however, is tedious, time consuming and is rarely impartial. The time constraints often mean that the examiner is unable to provide a detailed feedback to each and every student. This calls for the need to develop an objective automated grader system, which can investigate and analyze the student performances by considering different facets of learning based on semantic similarity. The enhanced BERT model, which has been fine-tuned, is utilized to capture the semantic characteristics found in the student’s response. In order to achieve this, the model compares the student’s response with the model answer and generates a model score based on the comparison. This model score is boosted through a keyword matching algorithm, which emphasizes the factual information contained within the student’s response. These final similarity scores are employed to offer comprehensive feedback that illuminates the specific areas in which the student’s comprehension may be lacking. Finally, the proposed approach is compared to other renowned algorithms like Cosine Similarity, Word Mover’s Distance, Paraphrase-mpnet, and Multi-qa-mpnet. The proposed system yields an experimental Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.11, which is significantly better as compared to other algorithms.","","979-8-3503-9447-4","10.1109/I2CT61223.2024.10543315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10543315","Subjective answer grading;Semantic similarity;Keyword matching;BERT;Deep learning;Natural language processing","Measurement;Flowcharts;Software algorithms;Semantics;Taxonomy;Prediction algorithms;Software","","","","16","IEEE","10 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC) has been applied in face recognition and the related problem. In this paper, we first argue that SRC is efficient in head pose estimation. Then we propose the Block based Spare Representation Classifier (BSRC) method to reduce the influence of the background in the multi-view face images. The motivation of BSRC is that since the face shapes are different for the discretional head poses, the background in the multi-view face image is difficult to be eliminated by the traditional ways, such as feature extraction. As a result, the features of the multi-view face contain the noise of the background, which caused the descend of the performance of head pose estimation. In this paper, a face region is transformed into many images with the different blocks are discarded based on the assume that the block maybe the background at the specifically pose. By this way, there is an image in which the influence of the background can be reduced greatly. Specifically, SRC is applied on each image and the final class label of the input face region is decided by maximizing of Sparsity Concentration Index (SCI). The experimental results on the head pose database show the effectiveness of BSRC.","","978-1-4244-6080-9","10.1109/ICCEA.2010.226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445677","","Head;Shape;Image databases;Face recognition;Layout;Computer applications;Application software;Computer science;System testing;Face detection","","6","","15","IEEE","12 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proteins with a similar sequence may have different structures, while the proteins with a similar structure may have different sequences. In the analysis of similarity in 3D structures of proteins, it remains difficult for the traditional methods using the spatial feature distribution and geometry or topology features of proteins to solve these problems. In this paper, a Tile-CNN network is proposed to analyze the similarity of proteins in 3D structure. In order to capture the overall and the local features as exhibited by the 3D structures of proteins, it projects 3D protein models into 2D protein images from different views and then cuts these 2D projected images using the tile strategy. After the training of proteins with these images in the Tile-CNN, the test protein model can be expressed by an analysis matrix, and then the similarity between 3D structures of proteins is computed using the root mean square distance (RMSD) for the benchmark matrix and the analysis matrix.

However, most redundancy-based program repair techniques do not reason about the repair ingredients- the code that is reused to craft a patch. We aim to reason about the repair ingredients by using code similarities to prioritize and transform statements in a codebase for patch generation. Our approach, DeepRepair, relies on deep learning to reason about code similarities. Code fragments at well-defined levels of granularity in a codebase can be sorted according to their similarity to suspicious elements (i.e., code elements that contain suspicious statements) and statements can be transformed by mapping out-of-scope identifiers to similar identifiers in scope. We examined these new search strategies for patch generation with respect to effectiveness from the viewpoint of a software maintainer. Our comparative experiments were executed on six open-source Java projects including 374 buggy program revisions and consisted of 19,949 trials spanning 2,616 days of computation time. Deep-Repair's search strategy using code similarities generally found compilable ingredients faster than the baseline, jGenProg, but this improvement neither yielded test-adequate patches in fewer attempts (on average) nor found significantly more patches (on average) than the baseline. Although the patch counts were not statistically different, there were notable differences between the nature of DeepRepair patches and jGenProg patches.

These shape descriptors are computed based on voxel patterns in target volumetric data. The technique uses small local 3 x 3 x 3 voxel regions to compute all the possible voxel pattern combinations, and classifies these voxel patterns into a small number of groups. NVP descriptors are computed easily from volumetric data. Although the descriptors are small in size, these descriptors efficiently classify 3D models that are represented by volumetric data.

In order to enhance the diversity in the ensemble, different training datasets created based on bagging technique are applied to an ensemble of pairs of feed-forward back-propagation neural networks created to predict the level of truth and falsity values. In order to obtain more accuracy, uncertainties in the prediction of truth and falsity values are used to weight the prediction results in two steps. In the first step, the weight is used to average the truth and the falsity values whereas the weight in the second step is used to calculate the final regression output. The proposed approach has been tested with benchmarking UCI data sets. The results derived from our technique improve the prediction performance while compared to the traditional ensemble of neural networks which is predicted based on only the truth values. Furthermore, the obtained results from our novel approach outperform the results from the existing ensemble of complementary neural network.","","978-1-4244-7421-9","10.1109/SNPD.2010.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521520","Backpropagation Neural Network;Complementary Neural Networks;Diversity;Bagging;Ensemble","Bagging;Neural networks;Natural languages;Buildings;Hybrid power systems;Ontologies;Software engineering;Artificial intelligence;Distributed computing;Bridges","","","","17","IEEE","26 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the service model derived from the developing context of services composition and the existing composite services in the services repository, we calculate the behavioral similarity according to the relations between states of each existing service model and that of the developing service model. Through this approach we can automatically model the request of services discovery and recommend the most suitable composite services to developers in the light of their behavioral similarity.

It can not only improve image detail quality but also reduce computational cost. Research on the human visual system suggests that our eyes are mainly sensitive to high-frequency contents. Inspired by this observation, we implemented a hierarchical process where an image was decomposed into a detail layer and a base layer. The detail layer is reconstructed through an over-complete dictionary while the base layer is interpolated by bi-cubic. Through these, we can keep the HR details better. Next is how to accelerate while keeping good quality. In our method, adaptive dictionaries are trained by feature clustering. Firstly, we train low dimension sub-dictionaries to reduce time complexity. Secondly, then we apply overlapping feature clustering to the training. Thus dictionaries can be adaptive and more complete. All these can also prevent sub-dictionaries with over strong independence but less compatibility. Besides, initializing the sparse coefficients also plays an important role in our acceleration. Experimental results validate that ours are competitive or even superior in quality than those produced by other methods and our test data indicates substantial reduction in processing time over other similar SR methods.","","978-1-4799-2764-7","10.1109/CISP.2013.6744001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6744001","feature clustering;super-resolution;Adaptive dictionary","Dictionaries;Image resolution;Signal resolution;Image reconstruction;Training;PSNR","","","","20","IEEE","20 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of current subspace clustering is to uncover potential structures hidden from diverse views, which can only be clustered in linear space. However, data points are typically collected from non-linear environments in real-world applications, leading to unsatisfactory clustering results. Such methods primarily focus on learning the direct similarity of the samples, ignoring the latent high-order correlations across views. As a result, it is challenging to visualize a distinct cluster structure. To this end, we offer a novel multi-view subspace clustering based on low-rank kernel and high-order similarity learning (LHMSC) in this paper. To mine the data worldwide structure in kernel space, the underlying consensus structure between various data points, and the inherent information of each view, it combines low-rank kernel learning and high-order similarity (HOS) learning into a single framework.

The fractal analysis allows studying the structure of complex objects, taking into account their qualitative specifics, for example, the relationship between the structure and the processes of its formation. When constructing a harmonic model of Titan, the method of expansion of topographic information into spherical functions was used. As a result, based on the harmonic analysis of the Cassini mission data, a topographic model of Titan was created. In the final form, the model describing Titan’s surface includes the expansion of the height parameter depending on the spherical coordinates into a slowly converging regression series of spherical harmonics. It should be emphasized that for modeling surface details of the surface on a scale of 1 degree, the order of expansion should be about 180, which requires an analysis of (180+1)2 harmonic expansion coefficients. An overdetermined topographic information system was solved to meet the regression modelling’s conditions. In this case, a number of qualitative stochastic data, such as external measures, were used together with the standard postulation of the harmonic system of the Titan model. As a result of a sampling of self-similar regions (with close values of the self-similarity coefficients) on the surface of Titan, coinciding with the SRGB parameter (characterizes the color fractal dimension), the elements of the moon’s surface were determined, which with a high degree of probability were evolutionarily formed under the influence of the same selenochemical processes.","2472-761X","978-1-6654-4503-0","10.1109/EWDTS52692.2021.9580988","Russian Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580988","digital modelling of space measurements;fractal geometry;fractal dimension of self-similar areas;an automated software package","Analytical models;Satellites;Saturn;Stochastic processes;Harmonic analysis;Fractals;Data models","","","","23","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Debugging and repairing IPFs is complicated by the large number of HTML elements and CSS properties that define a web page's appearance. Tool support is also limited as existing techniques can only detect IPFs, with the repair remaining a labor intensive manual task.

An additional advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is fully automatic and the user is not required to specify any criterion to terminate the density construction procedure. This is in contrast to an existing state-of-art kernel density estimation method using the support vector machine (SVM), where the user is required to specify some critical algorithm parameter. Several examples are included to demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to effectively construct a very sparse kernel density estimate with comparable accuracy to that of the full sample optimized Parzen window density estimate.

Among the commonly used TFA tools, sparse TFA (STFA) is an excellent one, which can obtain a TF spectrum with good readability. However, many STFA algorithms suffer from expensive calculation time and unavoidable prior knowledge, such as the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) and the sparse reconstruction by separable approximation (SpaRSA). Inspired by the unrolled algorithm and its successful applications in signal processing, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based ISTA unrolled algorithm, which is named the sparse time–frequency analysis network (STFANet). The STFANet contains two parts, i.e., the sparse TF spectrum generator and the reconstruction module. The former learns how to transform a 1-D seismic signal from a large amount of unlabeled data into a 2-D sparse TF spectrum, which is implemented based on the proposed unrolled iterative dynamic shrinkage-thresholding (UIDST) algorithm. Note that the UIDST algorithm is carried out by using a simplified DL network. The latter serves as a physical constraint of model training to ensure that our generator obtains an accurate TF spectrum, which is actually an inverse TF transform. In this study, the traditional inverse short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is utilized in the reconstruction module. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, we apply it to 3-D poststack field data. The results show that, compared with the traditional TFA tools, the STFANet can availably compute the TF spectrum with better readability, which benefits seismic attenuation delineation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3300578","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42274144); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:XZY012022086); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Project(grant numbers:2022M712509); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198290","Deep learning (DL);seismic attenuation;sparse time–frequency analysis (STFA);unrolled algorithm;unsupervised learning","Time-frequency analysis;Mathematical models;Approximation algorithms;Transforms;Signal processing algorithms;Optimization;Generators","","22","","58","IEEE","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Saturation attacks against the SDN switches and controllers are major security concerns in SD-IoT. When using the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory (DSE) to detect various saturation attacks, the simple mutual information calculation may cause information loss problem, leading to the decrease of detection accuracy. Therefore, how to avoid information loss problem to improve the detection performance is a key issue. Aiming to solve the above-mentioned issues, we propose KIND, a novel image mutual information-based decision fusion method for saturation attack detection in SD-IoT. The main idea of KIND is that it converts the probability matrix of binary classifiers to images and detects the saturation attacks by fusing these images. More specifically, when executing the evidence fusion, each evidence is converted to an image by a nonlinear transformation method. Each image is converted from the related probability-supported matrix. Then, the evidence can be fixed by comparing structural similarities among different images. After that, all evidence can be utilized to obtain the final detection results using the conducted combination rule. The evaluation results demonstrate that KIND can achieve high detection performance, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of TPR, TNR, FPR, FNR, accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, confusion matrix, ROC curves, PR curves, Chi-square test, correlation coefficient, and the quantitative strategy test.

To realize a high energy efficiency and high throughput, the accelerator architecture can be massively parallelized and tailored to vision processing, which is an advantage over software-based solutions and general-purpose hardware. In this work, we present an ASIC that is designed to learn and extract features from images and videos. The ASIC contains 256 leaky integrate-and-fire neurons connected in a scalable two-layer network of 8 × 8 grids linked in a 4-stage ring. Sparse neuron activation and the relatively small grid keep the spike collision probability low to save access arbitration. The weight memory is divided into core memory and auxiliary memory, such that the auxiliary memory is only powered on for learning to save inference power. High-throughput inference is accomplished by the parallel operation of neurons. Efficient learning is implemented by passing parameter update messages, which is further simplified by an approximation technique. A 3.06 mm2 65 nm CMOS ASIC test chip is designed to achieve a maximum inference throughput of 1.24 Gpixel/s at 1.0 V and 310 MHz, and on-chip learning can be completed in seconds. To improve the power consumption and energy efficiency, core memory supply voltage can be reduced to 440 mV to take advantage of the error resilience of the algorithm, reducing the inference power to 6.67 mW for a 140 Mpixel/s throughput at 35 MHz.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2014.2386892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015626","Feature extraction;hardware acceleration;neural network architecture;sparse coding;sparse and independent local network","Neurons;Encoding;Feature extraction;Image coding;Application specific integrated circuits;Inference algorithms;Image reconstruction","","59","","26","IEEE","20 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For ranked retrieval in a collection of objects based on series of multivariate observations (e.g., searching similar video clips to a query example), satisfactory performance cannot be achieved by using many conventional similarity measures that aggregate element-to-element comparison results. Some correlation information among the individual elements has also been investigated to characterize each set of multidimensional points for comparison, but with an unwarranted assumption that the underlying data distribution has a particular parametric form. Motivated by these concerns, measuring the similarity of multidimensional point sets is approached from a novel collective perspective in this paper, by evaluating the probability that they are consistent with a same distribution. We propose to make use of nonparametric hypothesis tests in statistics to compute the distributional discrepancy of samples for assessing the degree of similarity between two ensembles of points. While our proposal is mainly presented in the context of video similarity search, it enjoys great flexibility and is extensible to other applications where multidimensional point set representations are involved, such as motion capture retrieval.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2010.2085424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597949","Distributional discrepancy;hypothesis tests;multi dimensional point set;nonparametric;similarity measures","Principal component analysis;Australia;Proposals;Correlation;Materials;Electrical engineering;Scattering","","2","","36","IEEE","7 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A comprehensive comparison is conducted on a spatio-temporal space across various stimuli protocols. Summarizing our findings regarding the agreement of different time-series techniques for measuring intra- and inter-subject similarity, we present our approach and outcomes in two parts. In this first part, we employed two template-based time series similarity measures, namely normalized Dynamic Time Warping, and normalized Cross-Correlation. Additionally, we enhance our analysis by applying two time-domain filters- Adjusted Laplacian of Mean and Laplacian of Gaussian- for the extraction of specific spectral neural activity, followed by similarity measures. Our preliminary findings indicate that the proposed template-based pipeline can achieve an 86% accuracy rate in identifying individuals over the course of a week.

Because of the particularity of hardware architecture and the weak of performance, it’s difficult to implement strong security protection measures. Traditional vulnerability analysis methods rely on manual analysis and are not suitable for large-scale vulnerability analysis. In this paper, we analyze the raw feature of firmware functions and graph embedding network, and calculate the similarity among functions by using features’ embedded vector.

Their involvement in our daily life elevate the need for means to insure their resilience against attacks and failure. One major threat is the software monoculture. Latest research work demonstrated the danger of software monoculture and presented diversity to reduce the attack surface. In this paper, we propose ChameleonSoft, a multidimensional software diversity employment to, in effect, induce spatiotemporal software behavior encryption and a moving target defense. ChameleonSoft introduces a loosely coupled, online programmable software-execution foundation separating logic, state and physical resources. The elastic construction of the foundation enabled ChameleonSoft to define running software as a set of behaviorally-mutated functionally-equivalent code variants. ChameleonSoft intelligently Shuffle, at runtime, these variants while changing their physical location inducing untraceable confusion and diffusion enough to encrypt the execution behavior of the running software. ChameleonSoft is also equipped with an autonomic failure recovery mechanism for enhanced resilience. In order to test the applicability of the proposed approach, we present a prototype of the ChameleonSoft Behavior Encryption (CBE) and recovery mechanisms. Further, using analysis and simulation, we study the performance and security aspects of the proposed system.

This may result in increased system failure rates if not addressed correctly. While some of the faults are not permanent in nature, they can lead to malfunctioning in complex circuits and/or software systems. Moreover, automotive applications have recently adopted the ISO26262 to provide a standard for defining functional safety. One of the recommended schemes to tolerate faults is Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). However, traditional TMR designs typically consume too much space, power, and money all of which are undesirable for automotive. In addition, common mode faults have always been a concern in TMR which their effects would be increasing in compact systems. Errors such as noise and offset that impact a TMR sensor input can potentially cause common mode failures that lead to an entire system failure. In this paper, we introduce a new architecture and implementation for diverse TMR in a speed measurement system that would serve automotive cost and safety demands. Diversity TMR is achieved on a single chip by designing functionally identical circuits each in a different design domain to reduce the potential of common mode failures. Three versions of a speed sensing application are implemented on a mixed-signal Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) from Cypress Semiconductors. We introduce errors that impact speed sensor signals as defined by the ISO26262 standard to evaluate DTMR.

The symmetric Gauss-Seidel algorithm (GS) is an efficient iterative resolution method. However, its inherently sequential nature makes it challenging to parallelize. The state-of-the-art parallelization techniques for the GS iteration are based on the concept of graph coloring, and they have been exploited to speed up the execution of each iteration of the algorithm on CPUs, e.g., in the context of the HPCG benchmark. Nevertheless, existing hardware accelerators for GS execute the serial algorithm, often tailoring it to a specific application scenario, limiting its applicability. We propose a hardware-software codesign methodology that leverages state-of-the-art software graph coloring and a generator of domain specific architectures (DSAs) that computes GS using coloring-based hardware parallelization. PSyGS Gen (Parallel Symmetric Gauss-Seidel Generator) is the first architecture to parallelize the Gauss-Seidel iteration via graph coloring. By comparing the performance of the DSAs generated by PSyGS Gen to a parallelized version of the algorithm implemented using coloring and OpenMP and run on a CPU, we achieve from 1.23x to 34.84x higher parallel efficiency than the best CPU run. The DSAs generated using PSyGS Gen are programmable, therefore, they support any present and future coloring techniques. Moreover, they also support the execution of the algorithm for a fixed number of iterations, allowing its usage as a smoother in more complex iterative methods. These programmability features, with the solution being open-source and integrated with the Chipyard SoC generator, allow it to be integrated into more complex flows of computation such as the HPCG benchmark.","","979-8-3503-6460-6","10.1109/IPDPSW63119.2024.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596450","Gauss-Seidel;sparse linear systems;graph coloring;RISC;hardware acceleration;SoC;Chipyard;FPGA","Linear systems;Limiting;Scientific computing;Software algorithms;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Generators","","","","15","IEEE","26 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is an increasing need to detect similar code for vulnerability search across architectures with the increase of critical vulnerabilities in IoT devices. The variety of IoT hardware architectures and software platforms requires to capture semantic equivalence of code fragments in the similarity detection. However, existing approaches are insufficient in capturing the semantic similarity. We notice that the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a function contains rich semantic information. Inspired by successful applications of natural language processing technologies in sentence semantic understanding, we propose a deep learning-based AST-encoding method, named ASTERIA, to measure the semantic equivalence of functions in different platforms. Our method leverages the Tree-LSTM network to learn the semantic representation of a function from its AST. Then the similarity detection can be conducted efficiently and accurately by measuring the similarity between two representation vectors. We have implemented an open-source prototype of ASTERIA. The Tree-LSTM model is trained on a dataset with 1,022,616 function pairs and evaluated on a dataset with 95,078 function pairs. Evaluation results show that our method outperforms the AST-based tool Diaphora and the-state-of-art method Gemini by large margins with respect to the binary similarity detection. And our method is several orders of magnitude faster than Diaphora and Gemini for the similarity calculation. In the application of vulnerability search, our tool successfully identified 75 vulnerable functions in 5,979 IoT firmware images.","2158-3927","978-1-6654-3572-7","10.1109/DSN48987.2021.00036","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505086","bug search;binary code similarity detection","Training;Semantics;Prototypes;Computer architecture;Binary codes;Tools;Syntactics;Encoding;Open source software;Microprogramming","","30","","70","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
