We consider two state sequences in model checking: (i) the sequence in which new states are generated, and (ii) the sequence in which the states generated in sequence (i) are checked for property violation. We observe that neighboring states in sequence (i) often have similarities in certain ways. Based on this observation we propose a search strategy, which generates sequence (ii) in such a way that similar states are evenly spread over the sequence. As a result, neighboring states in sequence (ii) can have a higher diversity. A pilot empirical study with Java Path Finder suggests that the proposed strategy can outperform random search in terms of creating equal or smaller number of states to detect a failure.","2332-662X","978-0-7695-5039-8","10.1109/QSIC.2013.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605933","Model checking;random search;similarity-based search;heuristics;adaptive random sequence;Java PathFinder","Scattering;Java;Subspace constraints;Model checking;Search problems;Random sequences","","","","6","IEEE","23 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detecting bugs in large systems may significantly increase maintenance costs. Despite the fact that several techniques for clone identification have been proposed over the years, the accuracy and scalability of clone detection techniques remain hot research areas. Previously, Akram et al. proposed the DroidCC hybrid technique, where tokens were encoded into MD5 hash values by encoding them into 128-bit fingerprints, and clones were identified by matching identical hash values. Encoding tokens into MD5 hash values take more time due to the large fingerprint size of MD5 hash values. Due to the enormous chunk size, DroidCC cannot achieve higher accuracy. To overcome the weakness of the DroidCC technique, We proposed a novel AYAT a lightweight hybrid technique to detect clones at the fragment level. To speed up the detection process, we converted tokens into 32-bit polynomial values, and we set the chunk size to 5 lines per chunk to improve accuracy. We tested our technique on 10,968 java projects against 4.98 million lines of code. In comparison to the well-known DroidCC technique, it is significantly faster and more efficient. Our examination demonstrates that precision is significantly improved despite sacrificing scalability. AYAT code cloning detection technique has outscored DroidCC in every aspect.","","979-8-3503-3295-7","10.1109/ACCC58361.2022.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071576","CCD;Software Clone;Software Maintenance;Code-fragment-level clone;Hybrid CCD;Code Similarity detection","Computers;Software maintenance;Java;Codes;Costs;Scalability;Cloning","","1","","23","IEEE","22 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While developers often use automated oracles for detecting functional bugs, detecting performance bugs usually requires time-consuming, manual analysis of execution profiles. The human effort for performance analysis limits the number of performance tests analyzed and enables performance bugs to easily escape to production. Unfortunately, while profilers can successfully localize slow executing code, profilers cannot be effectively used as automated oracles. This paper presents Toddler, a novel automated oracle for performance bugs, which enables testing for performance bugs to use the well established and automated process of testing for functional bugs. Toddler reports code loops whose computation has repetitive and partially similar memory-access patterns across loop iterations. Such repetitive work is likely unnecessary and can be done faster. We implement Toddler for Java and evaluate it on 9 popular Java codebases. Our experiments with 11 previously known, real-world performance bugs show that Toddler finds these bugs with a higher accuracy than the standard Java profiler. Using Toddler, we also found 42 new bugs in six Java projects: Ant, Google Core Libraries, JUnit, Apache Collections, JDK, and JFreeChart.

However, most search-based methods encounter the mode collapse problem, leading to the generation of similar concrete scenarios for a given logical scenario. Besides, they require training different models for potentially diverse logical scenarios, which consume considerable time. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Stacked Action Blocks (SAB) framework inspired by reusable modularity in software architecture. In this framework, we extract atomic actions from logical scenarios and train each atomic action using a multimodal model as an action block to mitigate the impact of mode collapse. By reusing these trained action blocks, we compose diverse critical scenarios, thereby reducing training costs. We extensively evaluated our approach in four complex driving scenarios and achieved superior performance in the Critical Scenario Generation (CSG) task compared to heuristic methods and search-based methods. We demonstrate that the independent training of these action blocks that are reusable and modular is an effective way to find diverse multimodal critical driving scenarios. In addition, we show that the driving policy becomes better at avoiding collisions after fine-tuning based on these critical scenarios.","2640-0715","979-8-3503-4417-2","10.1109/APSEC60848.2023.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10479431","autonomous car;autonomous driving;AI test;reinforcement learning;critical scenario generation;simulation test","Training;Costs;Software architecture;Stacking;Search problems;Scenario generation;Task analysis","","","","50","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is particularly true when the autonomous system may have to choose between multiple exclusive objectives. The standard approach of testing robustness through fault detection is directly stimulating the system and detecting violations of the system requirements. Our approach differs by instead running the autonomous system through full missions in a simulated environment and measuring performance based on high-level mission criteria. The result is a method of searching for challenging scenarios for an autonomous system under test that exercise a variety of performance modes. We utilize adaptive sampling to intelligently search the state space for test scenarios which exist on the boundary between distinct performance modes. Additionally, using unsupervised clustering techniques we can group scenarios by their performance modes and sort them by those which are most effective at diagnosing changes in the autonomous system's behavior.","","978-1-5090-4633-1","10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7989173","","Software;Autonomous vehicles;Robustness;Fault detection;Software testing","","59","","21","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stability is important because feature selection methods which reliably produce the same results despite changes to the data are more trustworthy. Of the papers studying stability, most either compare the features chosen from different random subsamples of the dataset or compare each random subsample with the original dataset. These either result in an unknown degree of overlap between the subsamples, or comparing datasets of different sizes. In this work, we propose a fixed-overlap partition algorithm which generates a pair of subsamples with the same number of instances and a specified degree of overlap. We empirically evaluate the stability of 19 feature selection methods in terms of degree of overlap and feature subset size using sixteen real software metrics datasets. Consistency index is used as the stability measure, and we show that RF is the most stable filter.

In software, redundancy is useful (and used) in many ways, for example for fault tolerance and reliability engineering, and in self-adaptive and self-checking programs. However, despite the many uses, we still do not know how to measure software redundancy to support a proper and effective design. If, for instance, the goal is to improve reliability, one might want to measure the redundancy of a solution to then estimate the reliability gained with that solution. Or one might compare alternative solutions to choose the one that expresses more redundancy and therefore, presumably, more reliability. We first formalize a notion of redundancy whereby two code fragments are considered redundant when they achieve the same functionality with different executions. On the basis of this abstract and general notion, we then develop a concrete method to obtain a meaningful quantitative measure of software redundancy. The results we obtain are very positive: we show, through an extensive experimental analysis, that it is possible to distinguish code that is only minimally different, from truly redundant code, and that it is even possible to distinguish low-level code redundancy from high-level algorithmic redundancy. We also show that the measurement is significant and useful for the designer, as it can help predict the effectiveness of techniques that exploit redundancy.","1558-1225","978-1-4799-1934-5","10.1109/ICSE.2015.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194570","Software redundancy;functional equivalence;execution diversity","Redundancy;Software;Software measurement;Semantics;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","","16","","36","IEEE","17 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Like “traditional” software, DL systems are not immune to faults, some of which may even cause catastrophic disasters. As a mainstream testing technique for DL systems, fuzzing attempts to generate a large amount of semirandom yet syntactically valid test cases, from which the so-called adversarial inputs can be found, indicating the detection of faults. Test cases in fuzzing are generated based on a seed queue, which is constructed by randomly selecting seeds from the existing test suite (that is, the set of test cases). In this article, we propose a diversity-driven approach, namely DFuzzer, for constructing seed queues in fuzzing. We particularly develop two algorithms, namely DFuzzer-IB and DFuzzer-FB, based on the information theory and deep features, respectively, to improve the diversity of seed queues. Experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the proposed techniques based on five fuzzers, three datasets, and seven DL models. The experimental results show that both strategies can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art fuzzers for DL, including DeepXplore, DLFuzz, Tensorfuzz, DeepHunter, and DeepSmartFuzzer, not only in terms of finding more adversarial inputs for triggering faults but also achieving higher coverage.

As an initial try to detect semantic clones, in this paper, we propose a test-based approach to detecting methods that are semantically equivalent to API methods. For a given method m, we generate its test cases automatically and search for semantically equivalent API methods by running the generated test cases. If two methods generate the same output on each of the test cases, they are taken as semantically equivalent methods. One of the weakness of test-based clone detection is that it is often time consuming. To reduce the time complexity, we take the following measures. First, we focus on methods instead of arbitrary fragments. Second, for a given method, we only compare it against such API methods whose signatures are highly similar to that of the given method.

This paper summarizes the outcomes of a two-week focused effort. While the effort found no smoking guns indicating major test/fuzz weaknesses, it produced a large number of additional fuzz corpus entries, increased the set of fuzzers used for Bitcoin Core, and ran mutation analysis of Bitcoin Core fuzz targets, with a comparison to Bitcoin functional tests and other cryptocurrencies’ tests.

Central to these techniques lies the hypothesis that artificially seeded faults involve some form of realistic properties and thus provide realistic experimental results. In an attempt to strengthen realism, a recent line of research uses machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and Natural Language Processing, to seed faults that look like (syntactically) real ones, implying that fault realism is related to syntactic similarity. This raises the question of whether seeding syntactically similar faults indeed results in semantically similar faults and, more generally whether syntactically dissimilar faults are far away (semantically) from the real ones. We answer this question by employing 4 state-of-the-art fault-seeding techniques (PiTest - a popular mutation testing tool, IBIR - a tool with manually crafted fault patterns, DeepMutation - a learning-based fault seeded framework and $\mu$μBERT - a mutation testing tool based on the pre-trained language model CodeBERT) that operate in a fundamentally different way, and demonstrate that syntactic similarity does not reflect semantic similarity. We also show that 65.11%, 76.44%, 61.39% and 9.76% of the real faults of Defects4J V2 are semantically resembled by PiTest, IBIR, $\mu$μBERT and DeepMutation faults, respectively.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3277564","Luxembourg National Research Fund(grant numbers:C19/IS/13646587/RASoRS,PayPal); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10136793","Fault injection;fault seeding;machine learning;mutation testing;semantic model;syntactic distance","Syntactics;Semantics;Testing;Measurement;Codes;Bit error rate;Pattern matching","","3","","57","CCBY","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An analysis of which challenges in software engineering teams are most frequent is still missing. As teams are more international, it is more frequent that their members have different human values as well as different communication habits. Additionally, virtual team setups (working geographically separated, remote communication using digital tools and frequently changing team members) are increasingly prevalent. Objective: We aim to provide a starting point for a theory about contemporary human challenges in teams and their causes in software engineering. To do so, we look to establish a reusable set of challenges and start out by investigating the effect of team virtualization. Virtual teams often use digital communication and consist of members with different nationalities that may have more divergent human values due to cultural differences compared to single nationality teams. Method: We designed a survey instrument and asked respondents to assess the frequency and criticality of a set of challenges, separated in context ”within teams” as well as ”between teams and clients”, compiled from previous empirical work, blog posts, and pilot survey feedback. For the team challenges, we asked if mitigation measures were already in place to tackle the challenge. Respondents were also asked to provide information about their team setup. The survey included the Personal Value Questionnaire to measure Schwartz human values. Finally, respondents were asked if there were additional challenges at their workplace. The survey was first piloted and then distributed to professionals working in software engineering teams via social networking sites and personal business networks. Result: In this article, we report on the results obtained from 192 respondents. We present a set of challenges that takes the survey feedback into account and introduce two categories of challenges; ”interpersonal” and ”intrapersonal”. We found no evidence for links between human values and challenges. We found some significant links between the number of distinct nationalities in a team and certain challenges, with less frequent and critical challenges occurring if 2-3 different nationalities were present compared to a team having members of just one nationality or more than three. A higher degree of virtualization seems to increase the frequency of some human challenges, which warrants further research about how to improve working processes when teams work from remote or in a distributed fashion. Conclusion: We present a set of human challenges in software engineering that can be used for further research on causes and mitigation measures, which serves as our starting point for a theory about causes of contemporary human challenges in software engineering teams. We report on evidence that a higher degree of virtualization of teams leads to an increase of certain challenges. This warrants further research to gather more evidence and test countermeasures, such as whether the employment of virtual reality software incorporating facial expressions and movements can help establish a less detached way of communication.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3148539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706331","Software engineering;human challenges;virtual teams;human values;diversity;survey research","Software engineering;Software;Virtualization;Virtual groups;Cultural differences;Human factors;Productivity","","8","","56","IEEE","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Coverage-guided fuzzing aims to improve code coverage by generating offspring test cases through mutation, executing the program under test, and retaining interesting seeds for subsequent mutations using customized genetic algorithms. However, existing fuzzing tools rarely consider the similarity between seeds during mutation. Mutating similar seeds frequently generates similar offspring test cases, which results in similar coverage and reduces the efficiency of fuzz testing. To alleviate the impact of this problem on fuzz testing, this paper proposes a fuzz testing method based on seed diversity analysis, which focuses on the characteristics of seeds and uses byte sequences as a feature to measure the similarity between seeds. It collects seeds that can cover new edges and constructs a shorter seed queue with significant differences based on this feature, which replaces the original seed queue for mutation. Based on the proposed method, we implement the prototype tools AFL-Varied and Neuzz-Varied.

While assuring their safety and reliability is, thus, of great importance, it is also a huge challenge. Metamorphic testing (MT) has been shown to be one of the most successful testing techniques to validate automated driving systems (ADS) underpinning the AV. Having said that, there are still lots of rooms for further improving the ADS testing with MT. On one hand, the non-determinism in ADS’ behaviors poses great challenges for precisely judging their correctness. On the other hand, the testing scenarios used in the existing studies are still not very much complex for mimicking various realistic traffic conditions. In this study, we propose a new framework which takes into account the hypothesis testing to provide a more solid way for judging the non-deterministic behaviors of test outcomes. On top of that, we develop a new toolkit to implement more complex and realistic ADS testing scenarios. To demonstrate its practicability, we design complex traffic scenarios and pay attention to examine the ADS’ behaviors in non-collision cases which are often unable to be detected by conventional testing methods. It is then applied to test Autoware, a state-of-the-art modular ADS using the Carla simulator. An analysis of results with the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and Cohen’s d values reveals a large number of consistencies and reliability issues of Autoware. The findings highlight the flexibility and capability of our MT-based framework in validating the AV using a nondeterministic measure and realistic scenarios that can work in the absence of ground truth datasets.","","979-8-3503-0176-2","10.1109/MET59151.2023.00010","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190416","Metamorphic testing;self-driving cars;autonomous vehicles;diversity of traffic scenarios","Art;Conferences;Buildings;Solids;Behavioral sciences;Safety;Reliability","","","","30","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing works testing episodic decision-making models are not workable, since they neglect the nature of sequentiality and interactivity in MDP. While other works testing sequential decision-making models are challenged by low testing efficiency because the interaction of MDP is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an optimized fuzzing framework SeqDivFuzz which infers the sequence diversity during the MDP interaction process to effectively and efficiently test sequential decision-making models in blackbox settings. It adapts the existing fuzzing framework, including Seed Selection, Seed Mutation, Feedback Analysis and integrating a module of Diversity Inference to accelerate the fuzzing procedure. The module learns historical in-process information to check the diversity of test cases when running up to checkPoint in the course of MDP, and early terminating those non-diverse ones. We conduct experimental evaluation with four models involving three simulation environments. The results reflect that SeqDivFuzz exposes 12.3%~49.1% more crashes during a 12-hour testing procedure in four pairs of models and environments compared with the state-of-the-art fuzzing framework. The idea of in-process terminating can potentially boost other techniques for testing sequential decision-making models.","2332-6549","979-8-3503-1594-3","10.1109/ISSRE59848.2023.00041","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10301250","Fuzzing testing;Sequential decision-making;Markov decision process","Adaptation models;Video games;Decision making;Closed box;Life estimation;Fuzzing;Markov processes","","","","50","IEEE","2 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A semantic similarity measure between individual pairs of words, each taken from the two blocks of text, has been used in STASIS. Word similarity is measured based on the distance between the words in the WordNet ontology. If the vague words, referred to as fuzzy words, are not found in WordNet, their semantic similarity cannot be used in the sentence similarity measure. FAST and FUSE transform these vague words into fuzzy set representations, type-1 and type-2 respectively, to create ontological structures where the same semantic similarity measure used in WordNet can then be used. This paper investigates eliminating the process of building an ontology with the fuzzy words and instead directly using fuzzy set similarity measures between the fuzzy words in the task of sentence similarity measurement. Their performance is evaluated based on their correlation with human judgments of sentence similarity. In addition, statistical tests showed there is not any significant difference in the sentence similarity values produced using fuzzy set similarity measures between fuzzy sets representing fuzzy words and using FAST semantic similarity within ontologies representing fuzzy words.","1558-4739","978-1-7281-6932-3","10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177836","ontology;semantic similarity;fuzzy set similarity measures;human perception;sentence similarity measures","Fuzzy sets;Semantics;Ontologies;Fuses;Velocity measurement;Indexes;Software measurement","","7","","14","IEEE","26 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the networking literature the result of such transmission is referred to as collision. It has been recently shown that small user delays and carrier frequency offsets (CFO) between the users allow for blind collision resolution based on the measurements of a single receive antenna. This is achieved by oversampling the collision signal, and exploiting the information on the collided packets that is contained in the signal's polyphase components. In this paper, user pulse-shape diversity is investigated for separating collided users even when delays and CFOs are small. In particular, an iterative pulse shape design is proposed that enforces several desirable characteristics to each user's pulse shape function. The proposed approach is tested on a software defined radio testbed and also via simulations. Both simulations and testbed evaluation suggest that the proposed approach can be very successful in resolving the users under realistic signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. Resolving collisions can significantly improve throughput in wireless networks.","1948-3252","978-1-4244-3695-8","10.1109/SPAWC.2009.5161817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5161817","collision resolution;pulse shape diversity;blind user separation;successive interference cancelation;software defined radio.","Pulse shaping methods;Shape;Signal resolution;Delay;Software testing;Antenna measurements;Frequency measurement;Receiving antennas;Software radio;Signal to noise ratio","","3","","14","IEEE","10 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To understand properties of the space formed by all valid configurations, a feasible way is to select a small and valid sample set. Even though a number of sampling strategies have been proposed, they either fail to produce diverse samples with respect to the number of selected features (an important property to characterize behaviors of configurations), or achieve diverse sampling but with limited scalability (the handleable configuration space size is limited to 1013). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a scalable diverse sampling strategy, which uses a distance metric in combination with the novelty search algorithm to produce diverse samples in an incremental way. The distance metric is carefully designed to measure similarities between configurations, and further diversity of a sample set. The novelty search incrementally improves diversity of samples through the search for novel configurations. We evaluate our sampling algorithm on 39 real-world SPLs. It is able to generate the required number of samples for all the SPLs, including those which cannot be counted by sharpSAT, a state-of-the-art model counting solver. Moreover, it performs better than or at least competitively to state-of-the-art samplers regarding diversity of the sample set.

Then, by considering the software profiling results, a SPWS hardware accelerator was designed by using structural and generic VHDL. The SPWS hardware accelerator is composed of one Random Sampling Direct Memory Access Controller (RS-DMAC) and one Windowing and Sampling (WS) circuit. Later, the SPWS is integrated into the FPGA fabric of the SoC-FPGA to accelerate the whole modified sFFT algorithm. In this case, the software sub-system is managed by the Real Time Operating System (RTOS) QNX Neutrino.

However, the significance of derived scenarios is weakened by repetitive similar situations within the driving data, which increase the test efforts without providing new insights regarding the test of the ADAS. In this contribution, an automated selection algorithm for test scenarios based on relevant environmental parameters is presented. Starting with a randomly selected initial testset, the machine-learning concept of autoencoders is utilized to recognize novel scenarios within the data pool, which are iteratively added to the initial testset. Furthermore, the key parameters for the autoencoder's performance are shown in depths. The approach is fully automated, so that the identified novel scenarios within an entire testset are automatically combined to a reduced testset of unique relevant scenarios.

The property of structural similarity can be seen in circuits that are subjected to engineering change order (ECO), circuits that are modified during place and route, circuits subjected to retiming, and circuits with multiple similar cores. The goal of the paper is to determine the testability of a circuit (circuit2) given a test set for a structurally similar circuit (circuit1). This is achieved by transforming a test set generated for circuit1 into a test set for circuit2 as efficiently as possible, without repeating the entire test generation process.

When proposed, a similarity measure is usually tested to demonstrate its properties and advantages over the others. However, those tests are occasionally performed using a small number of examples that do not allow a researcher or practitioner to detect potential drawbacks. In this paper, an open-source software package whereby a researcher can empirically assess several (configurations of) similarity measures while comparing IFSs that characterize experience-based evaluations is proposed and presented. By means of the proposed package, one can (1) build a large number of IFSs according to different learning scenarios, (2) compare those IFSs using existing or novel similarity measures, and (3) generate a comprehensive report about how each similarity measure reflects a perceived similarity. Reports generated by the package show that only a few of the existing similarity measures reflect properly a perceived similarity when IFSs resulting from opposite learning scenarios are compared to each other.","1558-4739","978-1-5090-6034-4","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8015689","","Fuzzy sets;Software packages;Open source software;Software measurement;Decision making;Pattern recognition;Current measurement","","3","","27","IEEE","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional notion of diversity relies on ""independent"" generation of ""different"" implementations. This concept is qualitative and does not provide a basis to compare the reliabilities of two diverse systems. In this paper, for the first time, we present a metric to quantify diversity among several designs. Based on this metric, we derive analytical reliability models that show a simple relationship between design diversity, system failure rate, and mission time. In addition, we present simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of design diversity in Duplex and Triple Modular Redundant (TMR) systems. For independent multiple-module failures, we show that, mere use of different implementations does not always guarantee higher reliability compared to redundant systems with identical implementations-it is important to analyze the reliability of redundant systems using our metric. For common-mode failures and design faults, there is a significant gain in using different implementations-however, as our analysis shows, the gain diminishes as the mission time increases. Our simulation results also demonstrate the usefulness of diversity for enhancing the self-testing properties of redundant systems.","1089-3539","0-7803-5753-1","10.1109/TEST.1999.805794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=805794","","Failure analysis;Circuit faults;Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Protection;Redundancy;Very large scale integration;Software systems;Analytical models;Electromagnetic interference","","33","1","28","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One challenge that we have faced while applying MBT was the generation of test suites that were too large to be practical, even for simple coverage criteria. The goal of test case selection techniques is to select a subset of the generated test suite that satisfies resource constraints while yielding a maximum fault detection rate. One interesting heuristic is to choose the most diverse test cases based on a pre-defined similarity measure. In this paper, we investigate and compare possible similarity functions to support similarity-based test selection in the context of state machine testing, which is the most common form of MBT. We apply the proposed similarity measures and a selection strategy based on genetic algorithms to an industrial software system. We compare their fault detection rate based on actual faults. The results show that applying Jaccard Index on test cases represented as a set of trigger-guards is the most cost-effective similarity measure.

G3P has been shown capable of successfully evolving programs in arbitrary languages that solve several program synthesis problems based only on a set of input/output examples. Despite its success, the restriction on the evolutionary system to only leverage input/output error rate during its assessment of the programs it derives limits its scalabil-ity to larger and more complex program synthesis problems. With the growing number and size of open software repositories and generative artificial intelligence approaches, there is a sizeable and growing number of approaches for retrieving/generating source code (potentially several partial snippets) based on textual problem descriptions. Therefore, it is now, more than ever, time to introduce G3P to other means of user intent (particularly textual problem descriptions). In this paper, we would like to assess the potential for G3P to evolve programs based on their similarity to particular target codes of interest (obtained using some code retrieval/generative approach). Through our experimental evaluation on a well-known program synthesis benchmark, we have shown that G3P successfully manages to evolve some of the desired programs with all four considered similarity measures. However, in its default configuration, G3P is not as successful with similarity measures as it is with the classical input/output error rate when solving program synthesis problems. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-objective G3P approach that combines the similarity to the target program and the traditional input/output error rate. Our experiments show that compared to the error-based G3P, the multi-objective G3P approach could improve the success rate of specific problems and has great potential to improve on the traditional G3P system.","","978-1-6654-6708-7","10.1109/CEC55065.2022.9870312","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:13/RC/2094_P2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870312","Program Synthesis;Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming;Code Similarity;Multi-Objective Optimization","Codes;Error analysis;Measurement uncertainty;Genetic programming;Evolutionary computation;Benchmark testing;Software","","5","","33","IEEE","6 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a software fault-tolerant system using diverse versions of software components, a component failure caused by defects or malicious attacks can be covered by other versions. Machine learning systems can also benefit from such a multi-version approach to improve the system reliability. Nevertheless, there are few studies addressing this issue. In this paper, we experimentally analyze how outputs of machine learning modules can be diversified by using different versions of machine learning algorithms, neural network architectures and perturbated input data. The experiments are conducted on image classification tasks of MNIST data set and Belgian Traffic Sign data set. Different neural network architectures, support vector machines and random forests are used for constructing diverse machine learning models. The diversity is characterized by the coverage of errors over the test samples. We observe that the different machine learning models have quite different error coverages that can be leveraged for system reliability design. Based on the experimental results, we construct the reliability model for three-version machine learning architecture with a diversity measure defined as the intersection of error spaces in the sample space. From the presented reliability model, we derive a necessary condition under which three-version architecture achieves a higher system reliability than a single machine learning module.","2473-3105","978-1-7281-4961-5","10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8952144","Diversity, image classification, machine learning, reliability, software fault-tolerance","","","8","","32","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We developed ForkSim, a tool for generating datasets of synthetic software forks with known similarities and differences. This allows the performance of cross-project similarity tools to be measured in terms of recall and precision by comparing their output to the known properties of the generated dataset.

Sadly prior work in this area that compares two code bases for similarities does not help us in finding the reasons for the differences in performance. In this paper, we develop a tool, SoftMon, that can compare the codebases of two separate applications and pinpoint the exact set of functions that are disproportionately responsible for differences in performance. Our tool uses machine learning and NLP techniques to analyze why a given open-source application has a lower performance as compared to its peers, design bespoke applications that can incorporate specific innovations (identified by SoftMon) in competing applications, and diagnose performance bugs. In this paper, we compare a wide variety of large open-source programs such as image editors, audio players, text editors, PDF readers, mail clients and even full-fledged operating systems (OSs). In all cases, our tool was able to pinpoint a set of at the most 10–15 functions that are responsible for the differences within 200 seconds. A subsequent manual analysis assisted by our graph visualization engine helps us find the reasons. We were able to validate most of the reasons by correlating them with subsequent observations made by developers or from existing technical literature. The manual phase of our analysis is limited to 30 minutes (tested with human subjects).","2574-3864","978-1-4503-7517-7","10.1145/3379597.3387444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148752","Software comparison;Performance debugging;NLP based matching","Visualization;Technological innovation;Codes;Operating systems;Manuals;Machine learning;Libraries","","1","","83","","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As more and more DL software is made open-sourced, publicly available, and organized in model repositories and stores (MODEL Zoo, Modeldepot), there comes a need to understand the relationships of these DL models regarding their maintenance and evolution tasks. Although clone analysis has been extensively studied for traditional software, up to the present, clone analysis has not been investigated for DL software. Since DL software adopts the data-driven development paradigm, it is still not clear whether and to what extent the clone analysis techniques of traditional software could be adapted to DL software. In this paper, we initiate the first step on the clone analysis of DL software at three different levels, i.e., source code level, model structural level, and input/output (I/O)-semantic level, which would be a key in DL software management, maintenance and evolution. We intend to investigate the similarity between these DL models from clone analysis perspective. Several tools and metrics are selected to conduct clone analysis of DL software at three different levels. Our study on two popular datasets (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10) and eight DL models of five architectural families (i.e., LeNet, ResNet, DenseNet, AlexNet, and VGG) shows that: 1). the three levels of similarity analysis are generally adequate to find clones between DL models ranging from structural to semantic; 2). different measures for clone analysis used at each level yield similar results; 3) clone analysis of one single level may not render a complete picture of the similarity of DL models. Our findings open up several research opportunities worth further exploration towards better understanding and more effective clone analysis of DL software.","2643-7171","978-1-4503-7958-8","10.1145/3387904.3389254","National Natural Science Foundation of China (General Program)(grant numbers:61972373); CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program(grant numbers:20H04168,19K24348,19H04086,18H04097); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10186854","Code clone detection;deep learning;model similarity","Deep learning;Analytical models;Source coding;Semantics;Cloning;Speech recognition;Maintenance engineering","","","","67","","25 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This mechanism diversifies the target software into heterogeneous variants, making a specific attack chain unfeasible for the transformed variants. Enhancing the heterogeneity of these variants is important for this method to reach its expected security level. Additionally, limiting their execution overhead is necessary to ensure the availability of this protection. However, finding the optimal subset among a large number of diversified variants is computationally difficult. This creates a dilemma in software diversification schema where enhancing heterogeneity and reducing execution overhead are both desired.To ensure a determined code quality control in generating software variants, we propose a guided software diversification mechanism (called GuiDiv). GuiDiv formalizes the iterate-used transformations into a branching process of a tree (called DivTree) and introduces an optimization process (called nodemerging) to guide the diversification. The optimizer evaluates the intermediate compilation results using multi-target evaluation functions in each iteration. This process aims to optimize the contribution of structural heterogeneity from redundant instructions, allowing variants with higher structural dissimilarity and lower overhead to have a higher chance of participating in the next iteration. We developed a proof-of-concept compilation module and used OpenSSL as the performance benchmark. In the evaluations, compared to related schemes, GuiDiv can bring higher control flow dissimilarity in most test cases. Regarding the variant heterogeneity, variants generated by GuiDiv exhibit significantly lower execution overhead.","2324-9013","979-8-3503-8199-3","10.1109/TrustCom60117.2023.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10538815","internet of things;code-reuse attack;code randomization;guided software diversification","Codes;Limiting;Merging;Software algorithms;Quality control;Software;Security","","","","46","IEEE","29 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we address the problem mentioned above - reproducing the configuration-related vulnerability. We try to solve it by proposing a binary similarity-based method to infer the specific building configurations via the binary from crash report. The main challenges are as follows: precise compilation option inference, program configuration inference, and source-code-to-binary matching. To achieve the goal, we implement RoBin, a binary similarity-based building configuration inference tool. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we test RoBin on 21 vulnerable cases upon 4 well-known open-source programs.

To reduce this effort, and thus the overall cost of mobile app testing, we propose APPTESTMIGRATOR, a technique for migrating test cases between apps in the same category (e.g., banking apps). The intuition behind APPTESTMIGRATOR is that many apps share similarities in their functionality, and these similarities often result in conceptually similar user interfaces (through which that functionality is accessed). APPTESTMIGRATOR leverages these commonalities between user interfaces to migrate existing tests written for an app to another similar app. Specifically, given (1) a test case for an app (source app) and (2) a second app (target app), APPTESTMIGRATOR attempts to automatically transform the sequence of events and oracles in the test for the source app to events and oracles for the target app. We implemented APPTESTMIGRATOR for Android mobile apps and evaluated it on a set of randomly selected apps from the Google Play Store in four different categories. Our initial results are promising, support our intuition that test migration is possible, and motivate further research in this direction.","2643-1572","978-1-7281-2508-4","10.1109/ASE.2019.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8952387","Test migration, GUI testing, mobile apps","Graphical user interfaces;Mobile applications;Testing;Instruments;Banking;Google","","40","","34","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, from another research perspective, we propose a new and lightweight method to solve cross-version BCSD problem based on multiple features. It transforms binary functions into vectors and signals and computes the similarity coefficient value and correlation coefficient value for solving cross-version BCSD problem. Without relying on the CFG of functions, deep learning algorithms and other related attributes, our method works directly on the raw bytes of each binary and it can be used as an alternative method to coping with various complex situations that exist in the real-world environment. We implement the method and evaluate it on a custom dataset with about 423,282 samples.

State-of-the-art studies defined several app similarity functions by the metainformation of apps, such as descriptions and reviews, and succeeded to apply it to apps from Google Play. There do exist some app stores that provide similar app lists when people search. Obviously such similarity relation information will help improve similar app recommendation in app stores where app recommendation is of poor quality or even does not exist. However few methods take the existing similarity relations between apps from different app stores into consideration. Our approach attempts to use such relation information to learn a new app similarity function from these stores, and combine this new function with existing functions defined from meta-information of apps. With transfer learning, our proposed similarity function can be used in app stores where no similar apps are presented. Empirical results on Chinese app data sets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method significantly.","","978-1-5090-1893-2","10.1109/SmartCity.2015.175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463830","Mobile Application;Similarity Function;Recommendation","Kernel;Training;Mobile applications;Training data;Recommender systems;Google","","1","","5","IEEE","5 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) rely on manufacturing process variations to create unique identifiers that can be used for various security applications including authentication and secure access. For practical applications, PUFs are required to be unique for each chip. Such property cannot be ensured by design alone. Since PUFs rely on manufacturing process variations, there are no guarantees that two PUFs will never have identical properties. Therefore, testing becomes necessary to screen out PUFs that violate the above property. Despite decades of research on PUFs, there has been scant attention to the problem of testing PUFs for uniqueness. In this paper, we investigate the problem of testing PUFs for uniqueness and we propose techniques for Uniqueness testing.

While most defensive efforts against such attacks seek to identify bugs during debugging, an alternative method seeks to make exploitation harder without the need to first identify the bugs -- or even the fact that there are any. Time randomization introduces more diversity among instances of the same software. In much the same way that ASLR-induced diversity in memory locations thwarts attacks crafted for specific addresses, time randomization-induced diversity in thread timing aims to thwart concurrency attacks crafted for specific vulnerability windows. We study three implementations of time randomization, all using the injection of NOPs to alter program timing. Their application to two real-world concurrency bugs results in a marked increase in the cost to exploit those bugs. After demonstrating the effectiveness of the method, especially when NOPs are injected before library function calls following synchronization points, methods for improving the efficiency of this defense against concurrency attacks in future research are proposed.","","978-1-5090-2403-2","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2016.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502291","time randomization;concurrency bugs;software diversity","Concurrent computing;Libraries;Software;Delays;Computer bugs;Synchronization","","","","27","IEEE","4 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the surging research interest in BCSA, it is significantly challenging to perform new research in this field for several reasons. First, most existing approaches focus only on the end results, namely, increasing the success rate of BCSA, by adopting uninterpretable machine learning. Moreover, they utilize their own benchmark, sharing neither the source code nor the entire dataset. Finally, researchers often use different terminologies or even use the same technique without citing the previous literature properly, which makes it difficult to reproduce or extend previous work. To address these problems, we take a step back from the mainstream and contemplate fundamental research questions for BCSA. Why does a certain technique or a certain feature show better results than the others? Specifically, we conduct the first systematic study on the basic features used in BCSA by leveraging interpretable feature engineering on a large-scale benchmark. Our study reveals various useful insights on BCSA. For example, we show that a simple interpretable model with a few basic features can achieve a comparable result to that of recent deep learning-based approaches. Furthermore, we show that the way we compile binaries or the correctness of underlying binary analysis tools can significantly affect the performance of BCSA. Lastly, we make all our source code and benchmark public and suggest future directions in this field to help further research.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3187689","Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(grant numbers:2021-0-01332); Developing Next-Generation Binary Decompiler; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9813408","Binary code similarity analysis;similarity measures;feature evaluation and selection;benchmark","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Binary codes;Syntactics;Semantics;Licenses;Market research","","20","","166","CCBY","1 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An effective property-based test quickly generates many diverse valid test inputs and runs them through a parameterized test driver. However, when the test driver requires strict validity constraints on the inputs, completely random input generation fails to generate enough valid inputs. Existing approaches to solving this problem rely on whitebox or greybox information collected by instrumenting the input generator and/or test driver. However, collecting such information reduces the speed at which tests can be executed. In this paper, we propose and study a black-box approach for generating valid test inputs. We first formalize the problem of guiding random input generators towards producing a diverse set of valid inputs. This formalization highlights the role of a guide which governs the space of choices within a random input generator. We then propose a solution based on reinforcement learning (RL), using a tabular, on-policy RL approach to guide the generator. We evaluate this approach, RLCheck, against pure random input generation as well as a state-of-the-art greybox evolutionary algorithm, on four real-world benchmarks. We find that in the same time budget, RLCheck generates an order of magnitude more diverse valid inputs than the baselines.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","Samsung; Facebook; Fujitsu; NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1900968,CCF-1908870,CNS-1817122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284117","","Monte Carlo methods;Instruments;Reinforcement learning;Evolutionary computation;Benchmark testing;Generators;Software engineering","","2","","50","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a novel compressed sensing method for the reconstruction of MRI data, which uses a regularization strategy based on re-weighted TV to preserve image edges. This method also leverages the redundancy of non local image patches through the use of a sparse regression model. An efficient strategy based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to recover images with the proposed model.

In many cases, the mapping of plans to objective reward may change due to unforeseen events or circumstances in the real world. In those cases, the planner usually needs some additional effort to adjust to the changed situation and reach its previous level of performance. Whenever we still need to continue polling the planner even during re-planning, it oftentimes exhibits severely lacking performance. In order to improve the planner's resilience to unforeseen change, we argue that maintaining a certain level of diversity amongst the considered plans at all times should be added to the planner's objective. Effectively, we encourage the planner to keep alternative plans to its currently best solution. As an example case, we implement a diversity-aware genetic algorithm using two different metrics for diversity (differing in their generality) and show that the blow in performance due to unexpected change can be severely lessened in the average case. We also analyze the parameter settings necessary for these techniques in order to gain an intuition how they can be incorporated into larger frameworks or process models for software and systems engineering.","2474-0756","978-1-5386-5139-1","10.1109/ICAC.2018.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8498134","planning;resilience;robustness;self-protection;self-healing;diversity;optimization;evolutionary algorithms;unexpected events;dynamic fitness","Resilience;Planning;Optimization;Robustness;Production facilities;Evolutionary computation;Software","","6","","48","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
