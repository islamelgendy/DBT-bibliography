However, at the same time that brings more disadvantages to users such as the probability of user information leakage is higher. Among any other threats, Android application cloning has brought tremendous risks to the market environment. It is not always feasible to distinguish the applications by comparing application release dates or file sizes. In this paper, we perform a systematic analysis in Android applications. We test the difference of obfuscated and not obfuscated applications by Androguard to verify its resistance against Proguard at first. Then explain that modified applications may bring some disadvantages to unsuspecting users by smali instrumentation. We compute the similarity value of modified and original apps with Androguard. Finally, we use a testing tool based Robotium to detect the details such as the UI of applications. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the system in similarity detection. And we present the application of image processing technology in the similarity detection.","","978-1-5090-5521-0","10.1109/ICSAI.2016.7811010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7811010","Android;Smali instrumentation;Clone analysis;Similarity","Androids;Humanoid robots;Smart phones;Cloning;Instruments;Feature extraction","","6","","29","IEEE","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an investigation of different combined similarity metrics for extrinsic plagiarism detection is done and it focuses on unfolding the importance of combined similarity metrics over the commonly used single metric usage in plagiarism detection task. Further the impact of utilizing part of speech tagging (POS) in the plagiarism detection model is analyzed.

However, individual sensing system collects only one kind of signal, leading to a lack of accuracy to characterize the target. One of the most popular approaches to overcome single sensor assessment is data fusion. In our recent work, a new joint-sparse data-level fusion (JSDLF) approach to integrate heterogeneous sensor data for target discovery is developed in the matter of using a decentralized architecture algorithm. Several decentralized implementations of the data-level fusion approach based on the JSDLF approach were developed and investigated in the software aspect. In this paper, the hardware development of this algorithm will be displayed. Several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were utilized as nodes for image or RF SIGINT data processing. Meanwhile, a computer with RF SIGINT data processing communicated with these nodes as decentralized architecture as the hardware development of this algorithm. The performance of the decentralized hardware development is represented in this paper and the results are comparable with only software development in the algorithm.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843789","","Radio frequency;Target tracking;Surveillance;Software algorithms;Data integration;Computer architecture;Hardware","","","","31","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Real-time video decoding is crucial in practical scenarios. Recently, neural video compression (NVC) combines traditional coding with deep learning, achieving impressive compression efficiency. Nevertheless, the NVC models involve high computational costs and complex memory access patterns, challenging real-time hardware implementations. To relieve this burden, we propose an algorithm and hardware co-design framework named NVCA for video decoding on resource-limited devices. Firstly, a CNN-Transformer hybrid network is developed to improve compression performance by capturing multi-scale non-local features. In addition, we propose a fast algorithm-based sparse strategy that leverages the dual advantages of pruning and fast algorithms, sufficiently reducing computational complexity while maintaining video compression efficiency. Secondly, a reconfigurable sparse computing core is designed to flexibly support sparse convolutions and deconvolutions based on the fast algorithm-based sparse strategy. Furthermore, a novel heterogeneous layer chaining dataflow is incorporated to reduce off-chip memory traffic stemming from extensive inter-frame motion and residual information. Thirdly, the overall architecture of NVCA is designed and synthesized in TSMC 28nm CMOS technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our design provides superior coding quality and up to 22.7x decoding speed improvements over other video compression designs. Meanwhile, our design achieves up to 2.2x improvements in energy efficiency compared to prior accelerators.","1558-1101","978-3-9819263-8-5","10.23919/DATE58400.2024.10546891","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4400604); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10546891","Neural video compression;CNN-Transformer;fast algorithm;pruning;hardware accelerator","Computer architecture;Video compression;Streaming media;Hardware;Real-time systems;Energy efficiency;Encoding","","","","26","","10 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional dictionary learning methods usually treat each training sample equally, which would lead to the degradation of recognition performance when the samples from same category distribute dispersedly. This is because the dictionary focuses more on easy samples (known as highly clustered samples), and those hard samples (known as widely distributed samples) are easily ignored. As a result, the test samples which exhibit high dissimilarities to most of intra-category samples tend to be misclassified. To circumvent this issue, this paper proposes a simple and effective hardness-aware dictionary learning (HADL) method, which considers training samples discriminatively based on the AdaBoost mechanism. Different from learning one optimal dictionary, HADL learns a set of dictionaries and corresponding sub-classifiers jointly in an iterative fashion. In each iteration, HADL learns a dictionary and a sub-classifier, and updates the weights based on the classification errors given by current sub-classifier. Those correctly classified samples are assigned with small weights while those incorrectly classified samples are assigned with large weights. Through the iterated learning procedure, the hard samples are associated with different dictionaries. Finally, HADL combines the learned sub-classifiers linearly to form a strong classifier, which improves the overall recognition accuracy effectively. Experiments on well-known benchmarks show that HADL achieves promising classification results.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2020.3017916","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632006,61876012,61772049); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4202003); Beijing Outstanding Young Scientists Projects(grant numbers:BJJWZYJH01201910005018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9173647","Sparse representation;classification;AdaBoost;dictionary learning","Dictionaries;Training;Boosting;Task analysis;Face recognition;Visualization","","5","","62","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the fundamental data-translation process, its successful outcome is guaranteed if mappings are low-level, i.e. they satisfy schema constraints. The problem is that if similar services have been identified based on high-level mappings, then schema constraints may be violated. To overcome this problem, we propose a proactive approach to identify similar services that satisfy schema constraints. In particular, our approach follows a composite workflow (instead of existing hybrid workflows), which determines schema constraints (service documents do not specify them) and estimates service-translation cost (actual cost is not available) as a function of ensured schema-constraints. We compare our approach against a state-of-the-art service-similarity approach on benchmark services and the results show that high service-similarity does not necessarily imply low service-translation cost, the bidirectional nature of service similarity can be misleading, ensured schema-constraints improve service similarity, and estimated translation-cost is very close to actual cost.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029761","service interface;high-level mapping;schema constraints;translation cost;composite workflow","Software;XML;Object oriented modeling;Benchmark testing;Estimation;Electronic mail;Measurement","","1","","29","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to that, we proposed to combine REMS with vehicle type recognition (VTR) method known as Sparse-Filtered Convolutional Neural Network with Layer Skipping-strategy (SF-CNNLS). The purpose of using this method is to recognize and classify the vehicles that use the specific route. It is to prevent any vehicle other than public transportations use that route. The output from VTR will be used by REMS to trigger an immediate message to the authorities for further action. The major challenge of our method is to differentiate taxi and bus as public transportations with car and truck. This is because these vehicles have almost similar features. We tested our method with a self-obtained video that captured from a mounted-camera to observe if the challenge is able to be overcome. For the initial stage, the test is deployed on 4 major vehicle classes; car, taxi, truck and bus. The highest accuracy is obtained from car class with 92.5% and an average accuracy is 81.76%. Based on the test, we proved that our method is able to recognize and classify the vehicle classes although the vehicles are sharing almost similar features.","","978-1-7281-0851-3","10.1109/IEA.2019.8715122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715122","vehicle type classification;convolutional neural network;deep learning;computational intelligence","Feature extraction;Monitoring;Video recording;Public transportation;Roads;Convolutional neural networks;Automobiles","","2","","18","IEEE","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system performs FFT on the sampled real-time data and performs drone detection using the transformed data through two different methods, Plotted Image Machine Learning (PIL) and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The PIL uses image data from the visualized FFT graph to detect robust points, and compares the average image similarity with a reference FFT template associated with a target of interest. Whereas, the KNN uses FFT-format csv files to compare the average distance similarity. Experiments were performed with the two methods. As a result, the accuracy rate of 83% and 61% was shown in each of PIL and KNN. The major deliverables of this work are a software package framework one may use to experiment with various sound samples and classifiers via modifiable classifier modules and initial testing of two classifiers.

Our first contribution is to compute all UIO sequences of minimal lengths in a finite-state machine. Our second contribution is to present a generally efficient algorithm to compute a UIO sequence for each state, if it exists. We begin by defining a path vector, vector perturbation, and UIO tree. The perturbation process allows us to construct the complete UIO tree for a machine. Each sequence of input/output from the initial vector of a UIO tree to a singleton vector represents a UIO sequence. Next, we define the idea of an inference rule that allows us to infer UIO sequences of a number of states from the UIO sequence of some state. That is, for a large class of machines, it is possible to compute UIO sequences for all possible states from a small set of initial UIOs. We give a modified depth-first algorithm, called the hybrid approach, that computes a partial UIO tree, called an essential subtree, from which UIO sequences of all possible states can be inferred. Using the concept of projection machines, we show that sometimes it is unnecessary to construct even a partial subtree. We prove that if a machine remains strongly connected after deleting all the converging transitions, then all of the states have UIO sequences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we develop a tool to perform experiments using both small and large machines.","1558-2566","","10.1109/90.649519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=649519","","Protocols;Inference mechanisms;Circuit testing;Costs;Interference;Hardware;Sequential circuits;Program processors;Communication system control;Data communication","","25","1","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper introduces a method for finding distinctive features of a shape that are useful for determining shape similarity. Although global shape descriptors have been developed to facilitate retrieval, they fail when local shape properties are the distinctive features of a class. Alternatively, local shape descriptors can be generated over the surface of shapes, but then storage and search of the descriptors becomes unnecessarily expensive, as perhaps only a few descriptors are sufficient to distinguish classes. The challenge is to select local descriptors from a query shape that are most distinctive for retrieval. Our approach is to define distinction as the retrieval performance of a local shape descriptor. During a training phase, we estimate descriptor likelihood using a multivariate Gaussian distribution of real-valued shape descriptors, evaluate the retrieval performance of each descriptor from a training set, and average these performance values at every likelihood value. For each query, we evaluate the likelihood of local shape descriptors on its surface and lookup the expected retrieval values learned from the training set to determine their predicted distinction values. We show that querying with the most distinctive shape descriptors provides favorable retrieval performance during tests with a database of common graphics objects.","","0-7695-2591-1","10.1109/SMI.2006.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631200","","Shape;Spatial databases;Information retrieval;Application software;Computer graphics;Computer science;Phase estimation;Gaussian distribution;Testing;Design automation","","31","1","26","IEEE","26 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Quranic text contains two elements, namely, diacritics and characters. However, processing these elements may cause malfunction to the OCR system and reduce its level of accuracy. In this paper, a new method is proposed to check the similarity and originality of Quranic content. This method is based on a combination of Quranic diacritic and character recognition techniques.

However, attackers conceal a part of malicious data with evasion techniques to circumvent detection systems. In this paper, we propose a system for detecting malicious websites without collecting all malicious data. Even if we cannot observe a part of malicious data, we can always observe compromised websites. Since vulnerable websites are discovered by search engines, compromised websites have similar traits. Therefore, we built a classifier by leveraging not only malicious websites but also compromised websites. More precisely, we convert all websites observed at the time of access into a redirection graph and classify it by integrating similarities between its subgraphs and redirection subgraphs shared across malicious, benign, and compromised websites. As a result of evaluating our system with crawling data of 455,860 websites, we found that the system achieved a 91.7% true positive rate for malicious websites containing exploit URLs at a low false positive rate of 0.1%.

The enhanced version of these video frames is important as to assist law enforcement agency for investigation or to be tended as evidence in court. The most significant problem observed in the analysis is the enhancement of objects under probe in video. In many cases, the probes appeared to be in low-resolution and degraded with noise, lens blur and compression artifacts. The enhancement of these low quality probes via conventional method of denoising and resizing has proven to further degrade the quality of the prober The objective of this paper is to propose an enhancement analysis algorithm based on super-resolution. Hence, we present an solution which is a single-frame solution for super-resolution. For that purpose, our proposed method incorporates sparse coding with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization in order to improve hallucination of probes in video. Sparse coding is employed in learning a localized part-based subspace which synthesizes higher resolution with respect to overcomplete patch dictionaries. We test our proposed method and compare with state-of-the-art methods namely resampling and super-resolution method, by enhancing probes in exhibit videos.

The YoloV3-Tiny model is one of the architectures for real-time object detection, and it will create significant data movements. In the inference process, most of the processes used are convolution. While the results using pruning process applied on YoloV3-Tiny have a sparsity level of up to 75% in several layers, it means that the convolution process for the inference process will do many multiplication processes with zero values. In this accelerator, all weight data with a value of zero will be removed after the training process by pruning, then the input weight that enters the accelerator and carries out the convolution process without delay using “weight stream” dataflow. The results of the design test show that the results of the accelerator give the output of the convolution process faster when applied using trimmed sparse data. The calculation results of all YoloV3-Tiny layers when carrying out the convolution process using an accelerator designed have been estimated reduced 56% of the convolution process.

The scanner consists of a ring of dual-layer detector modules (O71 mm), each containing a 4/spl times/8 array of 2/spl times/2/spl times/6mm/sup 3/ (front) and 2/spl times/2/spl times/8 mm/sup 3/ (back) LSO crystals that are each optically isolated and coupled one-to-one to a monolithic 4/spl times/8 APD array. Signals from each channel are individually processed using fully-integrated 16-channel, low noise, charge sensitive preamplifiers and custom integrated electronics that include a four channel shaping amplifier, peak detector and non-delay line CFD. Analog-to-digital converters and time-to-digital converters digitise the pulse height and time-stamp each event, and data are stored exclusively in list mode format. Two 32-channel detector blocks were tested in a coincidence and in a dual-layer configuration. Coincidences were sorted post-acquisition in software, allowing for maximum flexibility in the data processing. Monte Carlo simulations have calculated the system spatial resolution to be 1.1 mm FWHM. Average energy resolution for a single detector block ranged from 20.2% FWHM to 23.9% FWHM. System pulse height linearity was measured, and all channels responded with R/sup 2/>0.9988 (Pearson correlation coefficient). Intrinsic uniformity for each detector block ranged from 2.0% to 4.8% (400 keV threshold).

The match between corresponding regions, HSM considers the relationship of all spatial pairs in two images, which includes more meaningful match than SPM.

A minimalistic attack is a specialized form of adversarial attack that aims to accomplish successful attacks at the lowest possible cost. Recently, transfer optimization algorithms have been applied to deceive previously trained policies by acquiring knowledge from previously solved tasks. Experiments indicate that the transfer optimization algorithms perform well compared to traditional optimization algorithms. However, current transfer algorithms for addressing minimalistic attacks not only select a single source task for knowledge transfer but also tend to overly rely on identified appropriate source tasks. To address this issue, this paper introduces a similar locality based transfer evolutionary optimization algorithm. It can adaptively select multiple source tasks and extract valuable knowledge from these source tasks. Moreover, by leveraging the concept of similar locality, the algorithm alleviates its excessive dependence on familiar tasks, thereby providing fresh knowledge for the optimization of the target task. On this basis, the algorithm can mine more valuable knowledge from the large source task space to achieve a successful attack in a shorter period. The algorithm is tested on three Atari games-BeamRider, Qbert, and Seaquest-demonstrating its ability and potential to outperform other transfer optimization algorithms currently available in solving this problem.","","979-8-3503-0836-5","10.1109/CEC60901.2024.10611980","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62372081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10611980","Minimalistic attacks;transfer evolutionary optimization;similar locality;fresh knowledge","Sociology;Fitting;Optimization methods;Games;Reinforcement learning;Security;Task analysis","","","","34","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm is motivated by the population's perception on the decision variable space. The proposed algorithm perceives the decision variable space by deploying airships to latent regions. The perceptions of different solutions are related by the similarity between their deployments and utilized differently by crossover and mutation. The proposed algorithm is tested on five designed problems compared with MOEA/D with the other popular reproduction operators.

The goal is therefore to minimize the time that the location of a host computer is exposed to attackers. Several moving target defense mechanisms have been introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of IP address-based MTD strategies. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no study with its focus on investigating the impact of both the IP address change rate and the host diversity on the success of the defense and in turn the failure of attacks. We present the results of an analysis performed on simulating a simplified attack scenario against hosts on a network.

However, the large amount of obtained features can suffer from the “curse of dimensionality” problem, especially for the small training sample set. Moreover, various spatial-spectral features can represent the characteristics of the hyperspectral image from different aspects. In this paper, a multiple 3-D feature fusion framework (M3DF3) has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. First, we extend the 2-D Gabor surface feature into 3-D (3DSF) domains to comply with the spatial-spectral structure of the hyperspectral image, which is directly applied on the original hyperspectral image instead of the Gabor features. Second, three 3-D feature extraction methods, including the 3-D morphological profile, the 3-D local binary pattern, and the proposed 3DSF, that, respectively, characterize the hyperspectral image from three different angles, i.e., morphology, local dependence, and shape smoothness, are fused under a multitask sparse representation framework to take full advantage of the multiple 3-D features together. The proposed M3DF3 approach was fully tested on three real-world hyperspectral image data, i.e., the widely used Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Houston University.

UAVs are controlled autonomously by a computer in the vehicle or under the remote control of a pilot stationed at a fixed ground location. There are a wide variety of drone shapes, sizes, configurations, complexities, and characteristics. Use of these devices by the Department of Defense (DoD), NASA, civil and commercial organizations continues to grow. UAVs are commonly used for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR). They are also use for combat operations, and civil applications, such as firefighting, non-military security work, surveillance of infrastructure (e.g. pipelines, power lines and country borders). UAVs are often preferred for missions that require sustained persistence (over 4 hours in duration), or are “too dangerous, dull or dirty” for manned aircraft. Moreover, they can offer significant acquisition and operations cost savings over traditional manned aircraft. Because of these unique characteristics and missions, UAV estimates require some unique estimating methods. This paper describes a framework for estimating UAV systems total ownership cost including hardware components, software design, and operations. The challenge of collecting data, testing the sensitivities of cost drivers, and creating cost estimating relationships (CERs) for each key work breakdown structure (WBS) element is discussed.

Of course, this ability is applicable in education fields, such as plagiarism detection in collecting assignments for designing UML sequence diagrams. However, the algorithm's ability to detect image similarity may be affected by disturbances or changes in the image. Therefore in this paper, we researched the effect of disturbances in UML sequence diagram images on the ability to detect image similarity that the Perceptual Hash algorithm can do. The image disturbances we studied are rotating and skewing, which may be reasonable for students. These disturbances were tested on digitally generated images. The test results show that the Perceptual Hash algorithm's ability to detect the similarity of UML sequence diagram images is not affected by disturbances that occur in the image. The algorithm can still detect plagiarism attempts on UML sequence diagram images that have disrupted with a similarity detection rate above 60%.","","978-1-6654-2580-3","10.1109/ICORIS52787.2021.9649542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9649542","Image Plagiarism;Image Recognition;Image Similarity;Perceptual Hash;UML Sequence Diagram","Resistance;Image recognition;Shape;Plagiarism;Unified modeling language;Education;Intelligent systems","","1","","16","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the required near-field scanning plane is large and time-consuming for such antennas. In addition, the positioning accuracy of sampling points decreased due to the use of mobile devices instead of near-field scanning frames. In order to solve the problems mentioned above, this paper proposes a phaseless near-far field transformation method based on low-rank matrix completion for outdoor near-field measurement. In this paper, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) element is taken as the antenna under tested (AUT), the Ansoft HFSS and MATLAB software are used for simulation. It is found that for 50% sparse matrix and 60% sparse matrix, the relative error of electric field amplitude completion is less than 0.0334 and 0.0118, respectively. The far-field pattern of the AUT is calculated by substituting a 50% sparse matrix into the near-far field transformation method proposed in this paper. The average error between the calculated value and the simulated value of the pattern is less than 0.5684dB. It can be considered that the proposed method can realize phaseless planar near-far field transformation under sparse sampling.","","979-8-3503-0976-8","10.1109/EMCSIPI50001.2023.10241726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10241726","Compressive sensing;Low-rank matrix completion;Phaseless near-far field transformation;Sparse sampling;Outdoor near-field measurement","Antenna measurements;Transmission line matrix methods;Phase measurement;Simulation;Shape measurement;Receiving antennas;Software","","","","13","IEEE","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specialized AI accelerator hardware systems have recently become available for accelerating AI applications. However, the comparative performance of these AI accelerators on large language models has not been previously studied. In this paper, we systematically study LLMs on multiple AI accelerators and GPU s and evaluate their performance characteristics for these models.

Two of such models are proposed, one based on random forest regressors and a second based on neural networks. The random forest is highly data-efficient but generalizes only moderately. The neural network is able to leverage a high-dimensional burner run input to perform automatic system identification and generalization. While the proposed approach can be applied to a variety of applications for which example data from well functioning controllers can be used to hot-start new ones, we applied it in this paper to three slider-crank setups performing a variety of similar tasks.

Let (Xi j : 1 les i les k,1 les j les n) be a matrix of random variables whose columns X1,..., Xn are independent and identically distributed and such that any two rows Xi, Xj for 1 les inej les k are independent.

The definition of measurement methods and metrics from the perspective of cloud providers is not finalized yet. This paper introduces two metrics: (1) the system operation learning rate and (2) the system entropy rate in the context of ITIL processes. Both metrics are used to evaluate the quality of IT service management processes (e.g. incident processes) and their relation to the rapid system growth in cloud systems. Moreover, the metrics indicate, if a resource expansion of a cloud is managed properly and how the ITIL processes are implemented within the cloud system.

In addition, the incomplete multi-view data problem is ubiquitous in real world but has not been studied for multiple clusterings. To address these issues, we introduce a deep incomplete multi-view multiple clusterings (DiMVMC) framework, which achieves the completion of data view and multiple shared representations simultaneously by optimizing multiple groups of decoder deep networks.

To further improve its convergence on MaOPs and its diversity for MaOPs with irregular Pareto fronts (PFs, e.g., degenerate and disconnected ones), we proposed a decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm with two types of adjustments for the direction vectors (MaOEA/D-2ADV). At the very beginning, search is only conducted along the boundary direction vectors to achieve fast convergence, followed by the increase of the number of the direction vectors for approximating a more complete PF.

Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results, cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because, it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more preferable than the other.

Recently, hashing methods are used for fast nearest neighbor search in large-scale data spaces, by embedding high-dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. Inspired by this, in this paper, we introduce a novel supervised cross-modality hashing framework, which can generate unified binary codes for instances represented in different modalities. Particularly, in the learning phase, each bit of a code can be sequentially learned with a discrete optimization scheme that jointly minimizes its empirical loss based on a boosting strategy. In a bitwise manner, hash functions are then learned for each modality, mapping the corresponding representations into unified hash codes. We regard this approach as cross-modality sequential discrete hashing (CSDH), which can effectively reduce the quantization errors arisen in the oversimplified rounding-off step and thus lead to high-quality binary codes. In the test phase, a simple fusion scheme is utilized to generate a unified hash code for final retrieval by merging the predicted hashing results of an unseen instance from different modalities. The proposed CSDH has been systematically evaluated on three standard data sets: Wiki, MIRFlickr, and NUS-WIDE, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodality hashing techniques.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2619262","Northumbria University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61528106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7600368","Cross-modality retrieval;hashing;discrete optimization;bitwise;unified hash code","Binary codes;Optimization;Boosting;Semantics;Quantization (signal);Data structures;Electronic mail","","62","","56","IEEE","19 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This task, however, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and visual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing methods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve this task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global caption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information cannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we seek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of an image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1) it is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase; 2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts in an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still an open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method. Specifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid more attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor, we group its rel-evant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph (ACG). Last, based on different ACGs, we conduct the multi-view caption generation to improve the content diversity of generated captions. Experimental results show that our method not only achieves SOTA performance but also generates diverse captions to describe images.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578069","","Visualization;Computer vision;Image resolution;Benchmark testing;Pattern recognition;Proposals;Optical character recognition software","","32","","50","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rise of augmented reality technology has attracted wide attention in the field of complementary medicine. The safe and low delay augmented-reality assisted surgery system can effectively guide the accurate operation. At the same time, augmented reality technology can make surgical sites more intuitive. In this work, we propose a novel surgical operating system that leverages coordinate system transformation and optical navigation to improve precision and safety. Our approach involves the integration of medical images and optical tracking devices before and during surgery to achieve coordinate transformation between the patient’s position, surgical instruments, and the pre-surgery CT scan. This process involves calibration, registration, and other critical procedures. At the same time, the study also introduced the function of augmented reality. Doctors wearing augmented reality glasses can use the system to see more vivid scenes of surgery. During the calibration phase, we utilize biplanar and interpolation algorithms to obtain the conversion relationship between the C-arm emission source and the X-ray image coordinate system. In the registration stage, we convert the preoperative 3D CT into a DRR image using digital reconstruction image technology, which we then register with the 2D X-ray during the operation. To optimize the iteration, we employ the improved Powell algorithm. The algorithm demonstrates an average angle and position error of 0.62° and 0.56mm, respectively. Through the transformation of spatial position relationship, the transformation relationship between preoperative CT and intraoperative patient position was obtained. A user-friendly, integrated software system has been developed that allows users to view the relative relationship between surgical instruments and patient position in CT in real time during surgery.

Inspired by these two capabilities of sparse representation theory, this paper proposes a novel collaborative sparsity-assisted fault diagnosis (CSFD) method. Specifically, due to the repeatability and sparsity of fault feature signal in the whole signal, the feature extraction capability of sparse representation is utilized to extract fault features and construct a feature matrix. Subsequently, owing to the sparsity of fault classification problem itself, the classification capability of sparse representation is employed to achieve fault classification. Moreover, fault feature extraction is a key issue for fault diagnosis. Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of fault feature extraction, a RC-adjustment strategy with the ability to adaptively adjust regularization parameter is designed to assist the generalized minimax-concave (GMC) penalty for feature extraction. The advantage of the GMC penalty is that it can establish a nonconvex sparse regularization model with convex optimization solution. Finally, the proposed CSFD method is tested and verified by Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset and actual engineering dataset. Especially, the diagnostic accuracy of this method can reach 99.92%, which is nearly 7.68% higher than the traditional method based on L1 norm penalty.

However, the conventional equivalent- Q or horizontal interval- Q estimation ignores that Q-distribution should hold the same ability for the subsurface structure characterization as seismic data. To pursue an accurate Q-model, we propose a technique for joint reflectivity and structural interval- Q estimation by using nonstationary sparse inversion. We designed a structural interval- Q model by dividing the seismic data into several structural layers with the interpreted horizon(s). Attenuations in each layer are close to each other and can be described by an equivalent- Q or gradient- Q. Based on the attenuation theory, the nonstationary sparse inversion is solved iteratively, where, at each iteration, the equivalent- Q of only one layer is optimized by searching for the corresponding optimum inverted reflectivity, leading to a structural interval- Q model. The main advantages of our method are its objectivity and accuracy because of the integration of the prior structural information from interpreted horizons into joint reflectivity-estimation and Q-estimation. The test of synthetic and field data clearly illustrates that the proposed method enables high-precision structural interval- Q estimation and sufficiently compensates for Q-related attenuation.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.2987395","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0702504); Major Scientific Research Program of Petrochina Science and Technology Management Department “Comprehensive Seismic Prediction Technology and Software Development of Natural Gas”(grant numbers:2019B-0607); National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2017ZX05005-004); Scientific Research & Technology Development Project of China National Petroleum Corporation(grant numbers:2017D-3504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080576","Interpreted horizon(s);inverted reflectivity;nonstationary sparse inversion;sparsity;structural interval-Q","Attenuation;Estimation;Wavelet domain;Data models;Phase distortion;Petroleum;Q measurement","","3","","17","IEEE","28 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fuzzy rule interpolation technique enables fuzzy inference to be performed over a sparse rule base, so it is natural to introduce FRI to support the ANFIS construction. In this work, a new clustering guided rule interpolation approach is proposed for the ANFIS construction problem. Different with most existing FRI based ANFIS construction methods that commonly conduct rule interpolation at individual rule level, the proposed method makes the interpolation to be performed on a cluster level. It adopts a clustering strategy to guide the rule selection and rule weights calculation processes, ensuring the rule similarity and diversity at the same time. Particularly, the proposed approach firstly generates a rule dictionary and divides it into several clusters. Following that a cluster guided method is designed for automated selection of relevant rules from each cluster to be included in subsequent interpolation process. Then the weight for each selected rule is calculated by considering both the cluster size and the cluster distance.

Extensive research has highlighted the potential of graph neural network (GNN) as a promising framework for exploring non-Euclidean dependencies within hyperspectral imagery (HSI). However, GNN has not been introduced to HTD. Additionally, achieving a balanced training set while effectively suppressing background remains a challenge. Therefore, we propose the cognitive fusion of GNN and convolutional neural network (CNN) for enhanced HTD (named as CFGC), which marks the first integration of GNN and CNN in HTD. Initially, using sparse subspace clustering (SSC) and a similarity measurement strategy, we select the most representative background samples for HTD. Subsequently, linear interpolation combines the prior target with the Laplacian-weighted prior target, yielding abundant targets with meaningful transformations. Finally, a fused network of CNN and GNN is utilized for training both the prior target and the constructed training set. Significantly, the incorporation of attention mechanism in both the CNN and GNN branches stands out as a noteworthy advantage, augmenting the models’ ability to selectively prioritize crucial information. Four benchmark hyperspectral images have been used in extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate that CFGC exhibits superior performance in HTD.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3392188","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20211201); Open Research Fund of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Optical Remote Sensing and Intelligent Information Processing(grant numbers:KF20230301); Marine Science and Technology Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:HY2018-15); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC2806002,2021YFC2801604); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506566","Attention mechanism;deep learning (DL);graph neural network (GNN);hyperspectral target detection (HTD);sparse subspace clustering (SSC)","Convolutional neural networks;Graph neural networks;Object detection;Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Detectors;Training","","","","76","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most popular approach is linear DA (LDA), which provides the C - 1-dimensional Bayes optimal solution, but only when all the class covariance matrices are identical. This is rarely the case in practice. To alleviate this restriction, Kernel LDA (KLDA) has been proposed. In this approach, we first (intrinsically) map the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and then use LDA to find the C - 1-dimensional Bayes optimal subspace. However, the use of KLDA is hampered by its computational cost, given by the number of training samples available and by the limitedness of LDA in providing a C - 1-dimensional solution space. In this paper, we first extend the definition of LDA to provide subspace of q < C - 1 dimensions where the Bayes error is minimized. Then, to reduce the computational burden of the derived solution, we define a sparse kernel representation, which is able to automatically select the most appropriate sample feature vectors that represent the kernel. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on several standard datasets. Comparisons are drawn with a large number of known DA algorithms.","1063-6919","1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270407","","Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Covariance matrix;Matrix converters;Symmetric matrices;Application software;Computer vision;Testing;Hilbert space;Computational efficiency","","3","","16","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In both cases, the essence remains the same and it is easy for one to see it, by comparing two samples or two source codes. The challenge however, is to automatically find groups of similar items in a large collection. Our research shows that we can apply the same techniques in order to cluster new malicious samples into malware families and detect plagiarized students work. The paper proposes a novel approach for computing the similarity between two items, based not only on their features, but also based on the frequencies of those features in a given population. The new similarity function was tested in a clustering algorithm and it proved better than other approaches.

In this work, we apply the formalism for granule formation proposed by us and studied over last few years which is based on similarity measures called Rough Inclusions. A proper study of rough inclusions has been done within Rough Mereology, a paradigm for approximate reasoning that is rooted in the theory of concepts called Mereology based on the notion of a part instead on the notion of an element like the naive concept theory. We give an outline of granulation theory based on rough inclusions; then, we discuss the most important consequence of similarity among objects in a granule, viz., the hypothesis that granules represent new objects, which preserve the most important features of objects in a granule. This leads to the notion of a granular decision system obtained by means of granulation from an original decision system. The hypothesis that granular decision systems reflect properties of original decision systems to a satisfactory degree, put forth by the author at 2005 and 2006 IEEE GrC conferences, has been tested with very good results.

However, the existing approaches for HFOs detection may not be applicable for MEG signals with noisy background activity. Therefore, we employ the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) and propose an SSAE-based MEG HFOs (SMO) detector to facilitate the clinical detection of HFOs.

One of the important challenges in this regard is the general inability of current APR techniques to produce patches that require edits in multiple locations, i.e., multi-hunk patches. In this work, we present a novel APR technique that generalizes single-hunk repair techniques to include an important class of multi-hunk bugs, namely bugs that may require applying a substantially similar patch at a number of locations. We term such sets of repair locations as evolutionary siblings - similar looking code, instantiated in similar contexts, that are expected to undergo similar changes. At the heart of our proposed method is an analysis to accurately identify a set of evolutionary siblings, for a given bug. This analysis leverages three distinct sources of information, namely the test-suite spectrum, a novel code similarity analysis, and the revision history of the project. The discovered siblings are then simultaneously repaired in a similar fashion. We instantiate this technique in a tool called HERCULES and demonstrate that it is able to correctly fix 46 bugs in the Defects4J dataset, the highest of any individual APR technique to date. This includes 15 multi-hunk bugs and overall 11 bugs which have not been fixed by any other technique so far.","1558-1225","978-1-7281-0869-8","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812131","automatic program repair, multi-hunk patches, code similarity","Maintenance engineering;Computer bugs;Cloning;Tools;History;Search problems;Syntactics","","54","","47","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The estimation is performed by utilizing an Adaptive Similarity-based Regression (ASR) approach. This constitutes the use of Support-Vector Regression (SVR) in conjunction with a similarity-based unlearning algorithm. It is demonstrated that this approach can adapt to the various properties of different mobile networks, while maintaining a fixed training set size. This is particularly useful in cases where training data is not available in large quantities, or the uplink rate is limited by the users subscription. ASR is developed as a set of modular components and as such can be used as an enhancement to protocols such as multipath Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), or as an aid to Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing. It is shown that the algorithm can achieve satisfactory performance with as little as 24 training samples, and can be deployed across different mobile networks without the need of pre-training. The solution is validated using a custom test-bed to perform mobile network measurements, gathering over 15, 000 measurement samples. In addition, the algorithm is tested using measurements collected under real life conditions both in a moving car and train. As there is a shortage of open source data in the field of rate estimation in mobile networks, we publish all of the data sets used in this paper to encourage further research on the subject.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.3000414","SCOTT from the Electronic Component Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:737422); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109551","Uplink data rate estimation;online learning;support-vector regression;similarity-based unlearning","Uplink;Estimation;Training;Logic gates;Sensors;Approximation algorithms;Neural networks","","8","","32","CCBY","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Large-Scale Network Community Detection Using Similarity-Guided Merge and Refinement","V. Tunali","Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Maltepe University, Istanbul, Turkey",IEEE Access,"2 Jun 2021","2021","9","","78538","78552","It is possible to extract valuable insights about the functional properties of a system by identifying and inspecting the community structure in the network that models the system. Community detection aims to extract these community structures from networks. Many community detection methods have been proposed that consider the problem from different perspectives. However, with the emergence of very large and complex networks from variety of domains, there has been a growing need for community detection methods that can operate at scale effectively and efficiently. Considering this, we propose a novel algorithm for large-scale community detection, based on two novel similarity indices we propose as well. In the first stage of our proposed algorithm, we generate candidate communities using a mechanism similar to information propagation very rapidly. Then, we merge small candidates that have fewer nodes than a calculated threshold with the larger ones using similarity between nodes and communities. Next, we engage a refinement operation on the candidates by moving all nodes to the candidates to which they are most similar using the same similarity index again. After that, we merge small communities with larger ones by using the similarity between communities until no gain in the modularity is obtained. Finally, in the last stage, we employ the same refinement operation as in the third stage. With an extensive experimentation on real-world and artificially-generated benchmark networks, we demonstrate and verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm scales very well with growing size and complexity of networks. Besides, our algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art community detection methods both in detection performance and computation time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3083971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9440929","Network community detection;network clustering;network science;network analysis;complex networks","Heuristic algorithms;Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Complex networks;Tools;Social networking (online);Partitioning algorithms","","7","","38","CCBY","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various wireless indoor localization techniques are emerging. Due to the wide deployment and availability of WiFi infrastructure, WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization has become one of the most attractive localization techniques. Site survey to build WiFi fingerprint library and fingerprint matching-based real-time positioning are based on WiFi indoor localization method two basic stages. Equipment heterogeneity and environmental dynamics are two main factors affecting indoor localization accuracy. In order to solve these problems, an algorithm based on Hierarchical Edit Distance(HED) function is proposed to realize calibrations-free fingerprint comparison of heterogeneous devices. RSSI information collected by different mobile devices is transformed into AP sequence. The hierarchical energy level of each AP is calculated according to the difference of the RSSI values. Then the distance between the WiFi fingerprints is calculated by edit distance. In order to locate WiFi fingerprint RSSI information, we use HED to obtain K neighbors, and use the WKNN algorithm to predict position. In order to verify robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm, five different mobile devices were used to collect WiFi RSSI information in three different types of indoor environments. The average localization accuracy was 1.5m.","","978-1-5386-3349-6","10.1109/BIGCOM.2017.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8113084","indoor localization;WiFi fingerprint;RSSI;edit distance","Wireless fidelity;Economic indicators;Heuristic algorithms;Robustness;Databases;Performance evaluation;Algorithm design and analysis","","3","","26","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce the amount of communication, the devices send quantized and compressed local decisions to the server, resulting in noisy global decisions. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between the optimization performance and the communication overhead. Existing works separately optimize computation and communication. In contrast, we jointly consider computation and communication over time, by encouraging temporal similarity in the decision sequence to control the communication overhead. We propose an efficient algorithm, termed Online Distributed Optimization with Temporal Similarity (ODOTS), where the local decisions are both computation- and communication-aware. Furthermore, ODOTS uses a novel tunable virtual queue, which completely removes the commonly assumed Slater’s condition through a modified Lyapunov drift analysis. ODOTS delivers provable performance bounds on both the optimization objective and constraint violation. As an example application, we apply ODOTS to enable communication-efficient federated learning. Our experimental results based on real-world image classification demonstrate that ODOTS obtains higher classification accuracy and lower communication overhead compared with the current best alternatives for both convex and non-convex loss functions.","2641-9874","979-8-3503-3414-2","10.1109/INFOCOM53939.2023.10229086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229086","","Performance evaluation;Costs;Federated learning;Computational efficiency;Servers;Noise measurement;Optimization","","","","50","IEEE","29 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Super-resolving a noisy LR text image results in noisy High Resolution (HR) text image, as super-resolution (SR) leads to spatial correlation in the noise, and further cannot be de-noised successfully. Traditional noise-resilient text image super-resolution methods utilize a denoising algorithm prior to text SR but denoising process leads to loss of some high frequency details, and the output HR image has missing information (texture details and edges). This paper proposes a noise-resilient SR framework for text images and recognizes the text using a deep BLSTM network trained on high resolution images. The proposed end-to-end deep learning based framework for noise-resilient text image SR simultaneously perform image denoising and super-resolution as well as preserves missing details. Stacked sparse denoising auto-encoder (SSDA) is learned for LR text image denoising, and our proposed coupled deep convolutional auto-encoder (CDCA) is learned for text image super-resolution. The pretrained weights for both these networks serve as initial weights to the end-to-end framework during finetuning, and the network is jointly optimized for both the tasks. We tested on several Indian Language datasets and the OCR performance of the noise-resilient super-resolved images is at par with the original HR images.","2379-2140","978-1-5386-3586-5","10.1109/ICDAR.2017.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8270014","Deep Learning;Stacked Sparse Deep Auto-encoder;Coupled Deep Convolutional Auto-encoder;Noise Resilient Super-Resolution","Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Optical character recognition software;Spatial resolution;Image denoising;Image recognition","","5","","23","IEEE","29 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From our experimentation and also from literature, it is seen that the performance of DL approaches on classification tasks is not satisfactory. Especially, the performance is seen to degrade with higher dimensionality and increasing number of classes. We propose a hybrid approach to overcome the classification problem encountered by DL approaches. The novel approach uses the strengths of data abstraction and reconstruction from the DL methods while realising a high classification accuracy through a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). In the proposed approach, data abstraction is achieved by the DL method and learned sparse codes are used as inputs for training the MLP. The training is relatively fast as the entire dataset need not be trained. The objective is to minimize the computational requirements for classifying complex datasets like Telugu OCR, without compromising the performance. The method has been tested on University of Hyderabad Telugu Printed Connected Components (UHTelPCC) and Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) datasets with results comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.","","978-93-5351-098-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940599","Dictionary Learning;Sparse Coding;Signal Processing;Telugu Optical Character Recognition (OCR);Deep Learning","Dictionaries;Optical character recognition software;Training;Encoding;Deep learning;Sparse matrices","","","","39","","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
