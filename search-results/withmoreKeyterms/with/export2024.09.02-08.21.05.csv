The success of AI-driven wireless systems hinges on the quality of the air-interface data, which is fundamental to the performance of AI algorithms. Within data quality assessment (DQA), the measurement of similarity and diversity stands as crucial. Similarity assesses the consistency of datasets in mirroring their intrinsic statistical properties, which is essential for AI model accuracy. In contrast, diversity relates to the models' ability to generalize across various contexts. This paper concentrates on these aspects of DQA and proposes a comprehensive framework for analyzing similarity and diversity in wireless air-interface data. Catering to various data types, such as channel state information (CSI), signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and reference signal received power (RSRP), the framework is validated using CSI data. Through this validation, we demonstrate the framework's efficacy in improving CSI compression and recovery in Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, highlighting its significance and versatility in complex wireless network environments.","2694-2941","979-8-3503-0405-3","10.1109/ICCWorkshops59551.2024.10615485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10615485","Data quality assessment;AI-enabled wireless communication;similarity;diversity","Wireless communication;Data integrity;Conferences;Atmospheric modeling;Wireless networks;Transforms;Artificial intelligence","","","","30","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Complex applications demand the full performance of commercial high performance multi-core systems of-the-shelf (COTS), with or without accelerators. While these systems are optimized for performance, hard real-time requirements and deterministic timing behavior are major constraints for safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, infrequent timing outliers caused by interleaved hardware-software effects of COTS systems complicate traditional worst-case design. This conflict often prohibits deploying COTS hardware and consequently prevents sophisticated applications, too. Recently, an approach called Timing Diversity was introduced, which proposes to exploit existing dual modular redundant hardware platforms to mask deadline violations. This paper puts Timing Diversity on a theoretical foundation and provides specification for different implementations. It demonstrates that Timing Diversity needs fast recovery to be effective, proposes a recovery strategy and provides a mathematical model for the reliability of the resulting system. Using experimental data in a Linux based system, it shows that fast recovery is useful, making Timing Diversity a realistic option for compute demanding hard real-time applications.","1558-1101","979-8-3503-9624-9","10.23919/DATE56975.2023.10137030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137030","","Autonomous systems;Reliability theory;Software;Hardware;Real-time systems;Mathematical models;Timing","","1","","16","","2 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a seamless and effective approach to realise a generic countermeasure against SCA attacks. XDIVINSA, an extended diversifying instruction agent, is introduced to realise the countermeasure at the microarchitecture level based on the combining concept of diversified instruction set extension (ISE) and hardware diversification. XDIVINSA is developed as a lightweight co-processor that is tightly coupled with a RISC-V processor. The proposed method can be applied to various algorithms without the need for software developers to undertake substantial design efforts hardening their implementations against SCA. XDIVINSA has been implemented on the SASEBO G-III board which hosts a Kintex-7 XC7K160T FPGA device for SCA mitigation evaluation. Experimental results based on non-specific t-statistic tests show that our solution can achieve leakage mitigation on the power side channel of different cryptographic kernels, i.e., Speck, ChaCha20, AES, and RSA with an acceptable performance overhead compared to existing countermeasures.","2160-052X","978-1-6654-2701-2","10.1109/ASAP52443.2021.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9516611","Side channel Attacks;Instruction Set Extension;Hardware Diversification","Performance evaluation;Embedded systems;Microarchitecture;Instruction sets;Software algorithms;Systems architecture;Software","","1","","32","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Debugging tries to locate the reason for incorrect program behavior by analyzing the states, which happen during a program's execution.

However, the high-dimensionality of profiles can cause MDS techniques to represent small dissimilarities poorly. We evaluate several variants of MDS on large sets of profiles, to see which techniques produce the most accurate displays. These include four previously proposed techniques -classical scaling followed by iterative majorization, energy minimization, ordinal AIDS, and cluster differences scaling - and two techniques of our invention - hierarchical MDS and sparse region scaling.

In this paper, we propose to tackle these problems by presenting VulDetector, a static-analysis tool to detect C/C++ vulnerabilities based on graph comparison at the granularity of function. At the key of VulDetector is a weighted feature graph (WFG) model which characterizes function with a small yet semantically rich graph. It first pinpoints vulnerability-sensitive keywords to slice the control flow graph of a function, thereby reducing the graph size without compromising security-related semantics. Then, each sliced subgraph is characterized using WFG, which provides both syntactic and semantic features in varying degrees of security. As for graph comparison, we take full usage of vulnerability graph and patch graph to improve accuracy. In addition, we propose two optimization methods based on analysis of vulnerabilities. We have implemented VulDetector to automatically detect vulnerabilities in software programs with known vulnerabilities. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of VulDetector.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2020.3047756","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972392,62072453); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2020164); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9309254","Vulnerability detection;code similarity;weighted feature graph","Syntactics;Software;Testing;Semantics;Security;Optimization methods;Lenses","","30","","53","IEEE","28 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a novel feature extraction technique, a series of Gabor wavelet filters with different scales and frequencies was applied on hyperspectral data to extract spectral-spatial-combined features, which produced impressive performance on pixel-oriented classification. However, the incredibly large number of Gabor features could cause too much burden for onboard computation, limiting the efficiency of the method. To make matters worse, due to the nonhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials as well as the different characteristics of the constructed Gabor filters, some Gabor features could have a smaller or even negative impact on material representation, deteriorating the classification accuracy eventually. In this paper, a Gabor cube selection based multitask joint sparse representation approach, abbreviated as GS-MTJSRC, was proposed for hyperspectral image classification. First, based on the Fisher discrimination criterion, the most representative Gabor cubes for each class were picked out. Next, under multitask joint sparse representation framework, a coefficient vector could be obtained for each test sample with the selected Gabor cube features, which could be directly used for the following residual-based classification. Experimental results on three real hyperspectral data sets with different characteristics and spatial resolutions demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2513082","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271022,61272050); Guangdong Foundation of Outstanding Young Teachers in Higher Education Institutions(grant numbers:Yq2013143); Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2014A030313556); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20140418095735628,SGLH20150206152559032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389391","Fisher discrimination criterion;Gabor features;hyperspectral image classification;multitask sparse representation;Fisher discrimination criterion;Gabor features;hyperspectral image classification;multitask sparse representation","Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Training;Data mining;Support vector machines;Kernel","","66","","70","IEEE","21 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a nonnegative sparsity induced similarity measure for cluster analysis of spam images. This similarity measure is based on an assumption that a spam image should be represented well by the nonnegative linear combination of a small number of spam images in the same cluster. It is due to the observation that spammers generate large number of varieties from a single image source with different image processing and manipulation techniques.

Given an observed failure that is reproducible under the same program input, this new approach uses two main techniques to reduce the state exploration cost. Firstly, the execution trace to be analyzed for the observed failure is successively narrowed by making the set of trace points in each step a cut of the dynamic dependence graph. Such a cut divides the remaining trace into two parts and, based on the sparse symbolic exploration outcome, one part is removed from further exploration. This process continues until reaching where the fault is determined to be. Second, the cut in each step is chosen such that the union of the program states from the members of the cut is of the minimum size among all candidate cuts. The set of statement instances in the chosen cut is called a minimum debugging frontier set (MDFS). To evaluate our approach, we apply it to 16 real bugs from real world programs and compare our fault reports with those generated by state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that the MDFS approach obtains high quality fault reports for these test cases with considerably higher efficiency than previous approaches.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2016.2632122","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61303053,61402445,61402303,61521092); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2015AA011505); National Science Foundation of United States(grant numbers:1533822); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755837","Fault localization;minimum debugging frontier set;sparse symbolic exploration;dynamic dependence graph","Debugging;Computer aided software engineering;Computer bugs;Software;Computer architecture;Computers;Indexes","","9","","47","IEEE","23 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For connectionist classifiers, generalization depends on several factors like the network architecture and size, learning algorithm, complexity of the problem and the quality and quantity of the training samples. Various studies on the generalization behaviour of a neural classifier suggest that the architecture and the size of the network should match the size and complexity of the training sample set of the particular problem. The popular ideas for improving generalization is network pruning by removing redundant nodes or growing by adding nodes to reach the optimum size for matching. In this work a feedforward multilayer connectionist model proposed earlier by Chakraborty et al. (1997) with a sparse fractal connection structure between the neurons of adjacent layers has been studied for its suitability compared to other architectures for achieving good generalization.

In this paper, we propose a general detection methodology and develop a system to stop memory disclosures. We observe that memory disclosures are not root causes but rather consequences of a variety of hard-to-detect program errors such as memory corruption and uninitialized read. We thus propose a replicated execution-based methodology to generally detect memory disclosures, regardless of their causes. We realize this methodology with Buddy: By seamlessly maintaining two identical running instances of a target program and diversifying only its target data, Buddy can accurately detects memory disclosures of the data, as doing so will result in the two instances outputting different values.

However, most existing MOIAs put more attention on maintaining diversity as the used clonal selection strategy will allocate more cloning for the sparse areas, which may hamper the convergence to speed to the optimal Pareto front, especially for some complicated MOPs. To alleviate the phenomenon mentioned above, we propose a dynamic mechanism into traditional MOIAs in this paper, aiming to balance convergence and diversity, called BCD-MOIA. First, MOP will be decomposed into several single subproblems by decomposition method, and then these subproblems will be optimized simultaneously. Second, we propose a novel measure metric instead of the crowding distance to assign the clone number for each solution, which includes two main parts. The first part focuses on the diversity performance, i.e., the perpendicular distance between solution and its associated weight vectors. The second part uses the aggregated function values quantified by the decomposition method, which is more efficient for accelerating the convergence speed and maintaining diversity as well. Moreover, a dynamic mechanism is performed during the whole evolutionary process, focusing on diversity and convergence at different stages. By this way, our proposed algorithm can tradeoff the performance on convergence and diversity dynamically. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm BCD-MOIA is validated by comparing with three competitive MOIAs and three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for tackling two sets of complicated problems.","2573-3311","978-1-7281-4248-7","10.1109/ICACI49185.2020.9177787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177787","immune algorithnb multiobjective optimization problems;convergence and diversity","Cloning;Convergence;Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms","","2","","26","IEEE","26 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the farthest-candidate approach is combined with the nondominated sorting to choose the new population for improving the diversity. Additionally, another version of NSLS (NSLS-C) is used for comparison, which replaces the farthest-candidate method with the crowded comparison mechanism presented in the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The proposed method (NSLS) is compared with NSLS-C and the other three classic algorithms: NSGA-II, MOEA/D-DE, and MODEA on a set of seventeen bi-objective and three tri-objective test problems.

In particular, unlike joint sparse representation, which only considers the consistency among sparsity patterns of multiple features, we combine the consistent and pairwise constraints, which not only learn latent discriminant representations for all features but capture the interactions between them. In addition, our framework is universal and easily adapts to other multi-feature sparse representation models by just tuning the regularization parameters.

Resulting from the internal similarity of DPs, implementation variants, and missing roles, approaches based on static analysis are unable to well identify structurally similar instances. Existing approaches further employ dynamic techniques to test the runtime behaviors of candidate instances. Automatically verifying the runtime behaviors of DP instances is a challenging task in multiple aspects. This paper presents an approach to improve the verification process of existing approaches. To exercise the runtime behaviors of DP instances in cases that test cases of legacy systems are often unavailable, we propose a markup language, TSML (Test Script Markup Language), to direct the generation of test cases by putting a DP instance into use. The execution of test cases is monitored based on a trace method that enables us to specify runtime events of interest using regular expressions. To characterize runtime behaviors, we introduce a modeling and specification method employing Allen's interval-based temporal relations, which supports variant behaviors in a flexible way without hard-coded algorithms. A prototype tool has been implemented and evaluated on six open source systems to verify 466 instances reported by five existing approaches with respect to five DPs.

Testing in Chinese FAQ system of specific areas, experimental result shows that the performance of the improved algorithm is superior to the traditional VSM-based sentence similarity algorithm evidently.","","978-1-4244-6585-9","10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5658525","VSM model;sentence similarity;FAQ;Chinese question answering system","Semantics;Accuracy","","6","","10","IEEE","6 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we interpret the image similarity assessment problem as an information fidelity problem. More specifically, we propose a feature-based approach to quantify the information that is present in a reference image and how much of this information can be extracted from a test image to assess the similarity between the two images. Here, we extract the feature points and their descriptors from an image, followed by learning the dictionary/basis for the descriptors in order to interpret the information present in this image. Then, we formulate the problem of the image similarity assessment in terms of sparse representation. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed feature-based sparse representation for image similarity assessment (FSRISA) technique, we apply FSRISA to three popular applications, namely, image copy detection, retrieval, and recognition by properly formulating them to sparse representation problems.

Use of these duals, plus some other slight modifications, leads to several new similarity metrics. We show that versions of several previously proposed metrics are optimal, or nearly optimal, for locating single bugs. We also show that a form of duality exists between locating single bugs and locating ""deterministic"" bugs (execution of which always results in test case failure). Duals of the various single bug optimal metrics are optimal for locating such bugs.

Large web systems are being made so complex that often the users have to make excessive amount of ‘navigational efforts’ to complete their tasks. We identify certain aspects which aggravate the ‘navigational burden’ of a user. Vital amongst them are, complex navigational structure of web, unfamiliarity of users with the website, and disagreement between the research community and practitioners. This paper is based on the empirical analysis of an experimental data obtained from the prospective students who were invited to interact with the websites of few world class educational institutions from four different countries. The data allows us to determine that despite active research in the area of usability engineering, the users still experience heavy ‘navigational burden’ while performing same task using similar systems. The users do not observe any improvement in their ‘familiarity’ with these web systems even when they interact with more than one such systems which serve similar functions. This leads us to propose a solution with a different approach that is; to resort to ‘Generic User Interface’ as a ‘standard’ for organizations serving similar functions such as universities, hospitals etc. We then present some convincing arguments to support our proposal and answer some of the opponent’s voices, followed by a brief discussion on the future work to be done in this direction.","","0-7695-2656-X","10.1109/SERA.2006.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1691395","","User interfaces;Navigation;Usability;Software engineering;ISO standards;Testing;Web sites;Educational institutions;Data engineering;Hospitals","","2","","33","IEEE","11 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper outlines the process used to develop a custom benchmark test used to evaluate three mid-range CAD tools: Solid Edge v.6, Solid Works 98+, and Mechanical Desktop v.3. Specific objectives of the exercise were to compare the mid-range tools against the current Unix-based CAD tool in order to: (i) ascertain if significant ""ease-of-use"" could be realized, and (ii) determine what capabilities would be lost (if these tools replaced the current tool) or gained (if they were used to augment the current tool). Topics addressed include: identifying tool requirements, conducting initial screening, developing evaluation tests, specifying both objective and subjective scoring systems, performing the tests, and presenting the results to users and executive management. The effects of a diverse product line on the benchmarking activity are noted.

This method aims to find the best solution in two phases using other known optimization methods. The first phase explores the search space, while the second phase tries to refine the best solution. In GSO, the population of the best individuals obtained from the first phase is used as the initial population for the second phase. This process is repeated until the stopping criterion is met. Although the knowledge obtained from the first phase is transferred to the second phase in GSO, there is no knowledge transfer from the second phase to the first phase. In this study, we propose a modification where the knowledge obtained in the second phase is transferred back to the first phase. Additionally, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, used as the search method in the original study, has a fast convergence problem, which hinders an effective discovery process in the first phase of GSO. To address this, the proposed diversity-guided modification regulates population diversity and enhances exploration. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, twenty-six traditional benchmark functions and three engineering design problems were used.

The EEG signals were considered as chaotic signals and this consideration was tested successfully by the computation of Lyapunov exponents. The computed Lyapunov exponents were used to represent the EEG signals. The aim of the study is discriminating the EEG signals by the combination of Lyapunov exponents and fuzzy similarity index. Toward achieving this aim, fuzzy sets were obtained from the feature sets (Lyapunov exponents) of the signals under study.

However, because of the insufficient parallelism, neither of the methods can saturate a large amount of compute units on modern GPUs.We in this paper propose a synchronization-free sparse LU factorization algorithm called SFLU. To saturate GPU cores, our method lets each thread block eliminate a column and runs all the thread blocks at the same time. Through communicating dependency information stored on global memory, all the thread blocks either busy wait to run or get updated by their previous columns.

Furthermore, for highly nonlinear modeling task, it is usually necessary to use a large number of rules which further weaken the clarity and interpretability of TSK FS. To address these issues, an enhanced soft subspace clustering (ESSC) and sparse learning (SL) based concise zero-order TSK FS construction method, called ESSC-SL-CTSK-FS, is proposed in this paper by integrating the techniques of ESSC and SL. In this method, ESSC is used to generate the antecedents and various sparse subspaces for different fuzzy rules, whereas SL is used to optimize the consequent parameters of the fuzzy rules based on which the number of fuzzy rules can be effectively reduced. Finally, the proposed ESSC-SL-CTSK-FS method is used to construct concise zero-order TSK FS that can explain the scenes in high-dimensional data modeling more clearly and easily.

The 2010 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicted that bio-medical chips will soon revolutionize the healthcare market. These bio-medical chips should be able to sense and actuate, store and manipulate data, and transmit information. To realize such bio-medical chips, the integration of embedded systems and microfluidics inevitably leads to a new research dimension for More than Moore and beyond. This tutorial will introduce attendees to the emerging technology of digital microfluidics, which is poised to play a key role in the transformation of healthcare and the interplay between biochemistry and embedded systems. Advances in droplet-based “digital” microfluidics have led to the emergence of biochip devices for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. These devices enable the precise control of nanoliter-volume droplets of biochemical samples and reagents. Therefore, integrated circuit (IC) technology can be used to transport and transport “chemical payload” in the form of micro/nanofluidic droplets. As a result, non-traditional biomedical applications and markets (e.g., high-throughout DNA sequencing, portable and point-of-care clinical diagnostics, protein crystallization for drug discovery), and fundamentally new uses are opening up for ICs and systems. However, continued growth (and larger revenues resulting from technology adoption by pharmaceutical and healthcare companies) depends on advances in chip integration and design-automation tools. In particular, design-automation tools are needed to ensure that biochips are as versatile as the macro-labs that they are intended to replace. This is therefore an opportune time for the semiconductor industry and circuit/system designers to make an impact in this emerging field. This tutorial offers attendees an opportunity to bridge the semiconductor ICs/systems industry with the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. The audience will see how a “biochip compiler” can translate protocol descriptions provided by an end user (e.g., a chemist or a nurse at a doctor's clinic) to a set of optimized and executable fluidic instructions that will run on the underlying digital microfluidic platform. Testing techniques will be described to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. Sensor integration and close coupling between the underlying hardware and the control software in a cyberphysical framework will also be described. A number of case studies based on representative assays and laboratory procedures will be interspersed in appropriate places throughout the tutorial. Commercial devices and advanced prototypes from the major company in this market segment (Advanced Liquid Logic, Inc.) will be described, and ongoing activity on newborn screening using digital microfluidic biochips at several large hospitals in Illinois will be highlighted. The topics covered in the tutorial include the following: 1) Technology and application drivers: Motivation and background, actuation methods, electrowetting and digital microfluidics, review of micro-fabrication processes, applications to biochemistry, medicine, and laboratory procedures. 2) System-level design automation: Synthesis techniques: scheduling of fluidic operations, resource binding (mapping of operations to on-chip resources), module placement. 3) Physical-level design automation: droplet routing, defect tolerance, chip-level design, and design of pin-constrained biochips. 4) Testing and design-for-testability: Defects, fault modeling, test planning, reconfiguration techniques, sensor integration and cyberphysical system design.","","978-1-4503-0715-4","10.1145/2039370.2039430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062311","Microfluidics;biochips;system-on-chip;design automation","Microfluidics;Medical services;Tutorials;Laboratories;Integrated circuits;Educational institutions;Biochemistry","","1","","","","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this limitation, we develop a new sparse coding algorithm named constrained sparse representation (CSR) for video anomaly detection, which explicitly takes the manifold structure of data into account. CSR assumes that each sample's sparse coding coefficient can be linearly reconstructed by the coding coefficients of its neighbors. Therefore, CSR algorithm can obtain relatively smoothly sparse representations along the manifold of data. We apply the proposed CSR model to video abnormal event detection task and conduct extensive experiments on the UMN database. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CSR model performed better than some related algorithms.","","978-1-4673-9613-4","10.1109/IMCEC.2016.7867110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7867110","local geometrical structure;sparse representation;abnormal event detection","Manifolds;Silicon;Encoding;Databases;Linear programming;Event detection;Sparse matrices","","","","11","IEEE","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the memory-intensive nature and irregular data access patterns inherent in SpMV, its acceleration is typically bounded by the limited bandwidth. Multiple memory channels of the emerging high bandwidth memory (HBM) provide exceptional bandwidth, offering a great opportunity to boost the performance of SpMV. However, ensuring high bandwidth utilization with low memory access conflicts is still non-trivial. In this paper, we present Cuper, a high-performance SpMV accelerator on HBM-equipped FPGAs. Through customizing the dataflow to be HBM-compatible with the proposed sparse storage format, the bandwidth utilization can be sufficiently enhanced. Furthermore, a two-step reordering algorithm and perceptual decoder-centric hardware architecture are designed to greatly mitigate read-after-write (RAW) conflicts, enhance the vector reusability and on-chip memory utilization. The evaluation of 12 large matrices shows that Cuper's geomean throughput outperforms the four latest SpMV accelerators HiSparse, GraphLily, Sextans, and Serpens, by 3.28×, 1.99×, 1.75×, and 1.44×, respectively.

Identifying the source of logs can provide the guidelines for subsequent log anomaly detection. To this end, this paper proposes a method for log recognition based on similarity determination, called ReLog. ReLog first takes the feature codes of the target logs and matches them with the log feature codes in the baseline. Then ReLog uses cosine function to calculate the cosine similarity. Finally ReLog selects the item with the highest similarity and meets the minimum threshold as the matching item, so as to identify the log. In order to verify the effectiveness of ReLog, we tested it on datasets of 15 types of logs including Hadoop, Spark, and Mac. The experimental data shows that the recognition rate of ReLog is 99.14% with a acceptable overhead. In addition, it is also able to identify the logs produced by different versions of the same software with a 99.99% recognition rate.","2831-4549","979-8-3503-0562-3","10.1109/AUTEEE60196.2023.10407537","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10407537","Log Recognition;Similarity Determination;Regular Expression;Cosine Similarity","Electrical engineering;Codes;Software algorithms;Software;Sparks;Anomaly detection;Guidelines","","","","13","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is achieved by lowering the individual probability of a successful attack to a level that makes the attack unfeasible. Unfortunately, the existing approaches are not applicable to safety-critical real-time systems as they induce unacceptable performance overheads, they violate safety and timing guarantees, or they assume hardware resources which are typically not available in embedded systems. To overcome these problems, we propose a safe diversity approach that preserves the timing properties of real-time processes by controlling its impact on the worst case execution time (WCET). Our main idea is to use block-level diversity with a large, but fixed set of movable instruction sequences, and to use static WCET analysis to identify non-critical areas of code where it can safely be split into more movable instruction sequences.","","978-1-5386-1956-8","10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328432","Security;Cyber-Physical Systems;Real-Time;Artificial Diversity;WCET","Security;Real-time systems;Layout;Cyber-physical systems;Embedded systems;Timing","","1","","37","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One example is the error of taking a reference in a paragraph on someone else's scientific work. Suppose the manual checking process is carried out to determine plagiarism actions. In that case, it will be difficult and lead to the big problems. A computerized system is considered capable of quickly finding similarities in writing articles or scientific works that lead to plagiarism. In this study, detection of similarity in the document that leads to plagiarism is carried out by building an inverted index for each sentence in document in the database by performing data preprocessing then testing one by one for each sentence in the test document using the VSM method with term-frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF). The results obtained are that VSM with TF-IDF weighting can calculate sentence similarity with a high similarity value of 1 (100%). However, VSM with this weighting does not consider the word's position, then using the proposal of a 1-gram word weighting technique with a comparison process from left-to-right (left-to-right) and right-to-left (right-to-left) between database sentences and sentences. The test shows that there are differences in the similarity results. In the sentence examination time on testing, it is also found that the more the number of examinations, the more time is needed in the process of checking the similarity between sentences.","","978-1-6654-2680-0","10.1109/DATABIA53375.2021.9650177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9650177","Plagiarism;Similarity;Vector Space Model VSM;Term-frequency;Inverse Document;1-gra","Weight measurement;Databases;Plagiarism;Manuals;Writing;Data science;Extraterrestrial measurements","","","","15","IEEE","24 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
