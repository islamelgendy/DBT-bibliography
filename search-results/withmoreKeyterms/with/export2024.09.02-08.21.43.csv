In this paper, we present a set of algorithms that generate numeric or soft labels to structure automatically and produce video similarity rankings. Exemplar frames are extracted from each video during the labeling process. We propose five types of learning algorithms based on the following three classes: affinity propagation, k-means or harmonic competition, and pairwise nearest-neighbor. For redundancy reduction, we also provide an algorithm that prunes excessive exemplars. The five learning algorithms produced creditable order-aware exemplar sets for the target videos. Because the content and lengths of the videos differ in terms of temporal order, we provide new methods to analyze the similarities between exemplar sets. The m-distance similarity measure is the core concept used for the global and local alignments performed on the obtained exemplar sets. Based on this comparison mechanism, we identified high-precision recall curves for all five methods. In terms of learning speed, the k-means and pairwise nearest-neighbor classes are recommendable. To facilitate similar-video retrieval, we developed a graphical user interface that accepts videos downloaded from the Web. By replacing a procedure in the software, the proposed similar-video retrieval system can accommodate more elaborate frame comparison features.","2161-4407","978-1-4799-1960-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280423","frame exemplar;numeric label;m-distance;similar-video retrieval","Floods;Redundancy;Software;Computational efficiency","","1","","17","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm has been implemented in a software package General Matrix Partitioner (GMP). We also present an integer linear programming (ILP) model for the same problem, based on a hypergraph formulation. We used both methods to determine optimal 2,3,4-way partitionings for a subset of small matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. For k=2, BB outperforms ILP, whereas for larger k, ILP is superior. We used the results found by these exact methods for k=4 to analyse the performance of recursive bipartitioning (RB) with exact bipartitioning. For 46 matrices of the 89 matrices in our test set of matrices with less than 250 nonzeros, the communication volume determined by RB was optimal.

In most cases, they embed the electronics for the independent control of (maximum) 256 probe elements. However, a higher number of channels is needed for the control of 2-D array probes. This paper presents a system architecture that, through the hardware and software synchronization of multiple ULA-OP 256 scanners, may implement advanced open platforms with an arbitrary number of channels. The proposed solution needs a single personal computer, maintains real-time features, and preserves portability. A prototype demonstrator, composed of two ULA-OP 256 scanners connected to 512 elements of a matrix array, was implemented and tested according to different channel configurations. Experiments performed under MATLAB control confirmed that by doubling the number of elements (from 256 to 512) the signal-to-noise and contrast ratios improve by 9 dB and 3 dB, respectively. Furthermore, as a full 512-channel scanner, the demonstrator can produce real-time B-mode images at 18 Hz, high enough for probe positioning during acquisitions. Also, the demonstrator permitted the implementation of a new high frame rate, bi-plane, triplex modality. All probe elements are excited to simultaneously produce two planar, perpendicular diverging waves. Each scanner independently processes the echoes received by the 256 connected elements to beamform 1300 frames per second. For each insonified plane, good quality morphological (B-mode), qualitative (color flow-), and quantitative (spectral-) Doppler images are finally shown in real-time by a dedicated interface.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2021.3077664","Moore4Medical Project; Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership(grant numbers:H2020-ECSEL-2019-IA-876190); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424708","3-D beamforming;high frame rate imaging;matrix array;multi-channel;open scanner;sparse array;synchronization;ultrasound","Software;Synchronization;Real-time systems;Iron;Field programmable gate arrays;Probes;Delays","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Software;Ultrasonography","15","","49","CCBYNCND","6 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The VMI storage management require dealing with multiple VMIs, typically in the magnitude of gigabytes, which entails VMI sprawl issues hindering the elastic resource management and provisioning. Nevertheless, existing techniques to facilitate VMI management overlook VMI semantics (i.e at the level of base image and software packages) with either restricted possibility to identify and extract reusable functionalities or with higher VMI publish and retrieval overheads. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate Expelliarmus, a novel VMI management system that helps to minimize storage, publish and retrieval overheads. To achieve this goal, Expelliarmus incorporates three complementary features. First, it makes use of VMIs modelled as semantic graphs to expedite the similarity computation between multiple VMIs. Second, Expelliarmus provides a semantic aware VMI decomposition and base image selection to extract and store non-redundant base image and software packages. Third, Expelliarmus can also assemble VMIs based on the required software packages upon user request. We evaluate Expelliarmus through a representative set of synthetic Cloud VMIs on the real test-bed. Experimental results show that our semantic-centric approach is able to optimize repository size by 2.2 - 16 times compared to state-of-the-art systems (e.g. IBM's Mirage and Hemera) with significant VMI publish and slight retrieval performance improvement.","1530-2075","978-1-7281-1246-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820973","Virtual machine image management, semantic similarity, storage optimization.","Semantics;Software packages;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Linux;Resource management;Optimization","","2","","31","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modified locust swarm algorithm avoids concentration of individuals at the current best positions, reduces the probability of premature convergence, and maintains the intensification/diversification balance. The modified spider colony algorithm models two unique behavior patterns, allows diversification of the search space for the optimal solution, and acts as a filter to reduce the influence of very good or bad solutions on the search process. Hybridization of the modified algorithms is done by combining them sequentially (preprocessor/post-processor). We experimentally tested the algorithm on seven known multivariate functions. We compared the results with competing algorithms for particle swarm, differential evolution, and colony of bees. The proposed algorithm provides better results for all considered functions. Checking the statistical significance of the results obtained using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent samples showed that the algorithm results are statistically significant.","","979-8-3503-7136-9","10.1109/Inforino60363.2024.10552010","Russian Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10552010","algorithm;global optimum;agent;locust swarm;spider colony;behavior pattern;search intensification;search diversification;test function;Wilcowon test","Memetics;Renewable energy sources;Heuristic algorithms;Metaheuristics;Search engines;Search problems;Particle swarm optimization","","","","16","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The language generally contains abbreviations or strange words that have absolutely no connection with the word in question, this often leads to ambiguity when analysis such as sentiment analysis and Information Retrieval (IR). But lately there has been a slang dictionary that keeps a list of slang words that are often used by internet users, the dictionary informs slang words into words in formal Indonesian. But there are still many studies, especially text mining that ignores or does not filter out the word slang so that it will likely affect the results in research that has been done. The Nazief & Adriani algorithm is an algorithm to transform basic forms using Indonesian morphology by eliminating prefixes and suffixes. The Ratcliff/Obershelp algorithm can determine the similarity between two strings by matching the two strings. The purpose of this study is to compare the word slang to the formal word Indonesian, it aims to find out the similarity between the word slang with the formal word so that it will be known the percentage level of slang similarity with the formal word to find out whether the formal basic word can indirectly representing the word slang with the degree of similarity.

A recent differential testing of three state-of- the-art AST mapping algorithms, i.e., GumTree, MTDiff, and IJM, reveals that the algorithms generate inaccurate mappings for a considerable number of file revisions. We find that the inaccurate mappings could be caused by the mutual influence: the mappings of lower-level AST nodes (e.g., tokens) have impacts on the mappings of higher-level AST nodes (e.g., statements) and vice versa. This mutual influence issue is rarely considered by existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called iASTMapper, that iteratively map two ASTs based on the similarities between AST nodes. Given a file revision, we extract three types of AST nodes in different levels of program structures (i.e., tokens, statements, and inner-statements) from the ASTs of the two source code files. We first build mappings of the unchanged statements and inner-statements. Then, we use an iterative method to map the rest of the nodes without mapping. For each of the three types of nodes, we iteratively map the nodes based on their similarities measured using heuristic rules. We further use an iterative mechanism to connect the three iterative mapping processes by considering the mutual influence between the mappings of different types of nodes. Finally, a series of code edit actions are generated from the node mappings to help users understand and locate the code changes during revisions. We conduct experiments to compare iASTMapper with three baselines, i.e., GumTree, MTDiff, and IJM, by automatically evaluating 210,997 file revisions from ten Java projects. Furthermore, we manually evaluate the correctness of the code edit actions generated for 200 file revisions with 12 evaluators. The results demonstrate that iASTMapper outperforms the baselines. iASTMapper can generate shorter code edit actions by at least 1.29% than the baselines, with a high accuracy of 96.23%.","2643-1572","979-8-3503-2996-4","10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298413","AST mapping;Code change analysis","Java;Codes;Source coding;Software algorithms;Syntactics;Iterative algorithms;Testing","","","","36","IEEE","8 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By far, recognizing similar components in binary code remains a challenge. Existing research employs either static or dynamic approaches to capture program syntax or semantics-level features for comparison. However, there exist multiple design limitations in previous work, which result in relatively high cost, low accuracy and scalability, and thus severely impede their practical use. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages in-memory fuzzing for binary code similarity analysis. Our prototype tool IMF-SIM applies in-memory fuzzing to launch analysis towards every function and collect traces of different kinds of program behaviors. The similarity score of two behavior traces is computed according to their longest common subsequence. To compare two functions, a feature vector is generated, whose elements are the similarity scores of the behavior trace-level comparisons. We train a machine learning model through labeled feature vectors; later, for a given feature vector by comparing two functions, the trained model gives a final score, representing the similarity score of the two functions. We evaluate IMF-SIM against binaries compiled by different compilers, optimizations, and commonly-used obfuscation methods, in total over one thousand binary executables. Our evaluation shows that IMF-SIM notably outperforms existing tools with higher accuracy and broader application scopes.","","978-1-5386-2684-9","10.1109/ASE.2017.8115645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115645","In-memory fuzzing;code similarity;reverse engineering;taint analysis","Binary codes;Tools;Runtime;Indexes;Syntactics","","27","","65","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes to use low-rank representation to extract as much noiseless discriminative information as possible from finger vein images. However, image deformation and image quality variations weaken the correlation of genuine images, and therefore damage the low-rank linear representation. To further deal with this problem, the class labels of training images and the local geometric structure between testing images and training images, reflected by sparse reconstruction errors of testing images, are used as constraints of low-rank coefficients. In particular, vein backbone decomposition based sparse representation is proposed to fast compute the deformation-robust reconstruction errors of each testing image. The reconstruction error on sub-backbones of one training image are used and modified as the constraint of the low-rank coefficient on this training image. We evaluate the proposed method on three widely used finger vein databases, and experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in finger vein recognition.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3118894","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076151,61703235,U1903127); Key Research and Development Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019GGX101068); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564038","Finger vein recognition;low rank representation;sparse representation;vein backbone decomposition;reconstruction error","Veins;Training data;Image recognition;Ranking (statistics);Image reconstruction;Feature extraction;Face recognition;Fingers","","29","","46","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the multiple missing parts are continuous, the problem is reduced to activity recognition in videos with single part missing at any position which is focused on by many researches. However, in many practical applications, some temporal gaps always appear in captured videos due to random frame loss(e.g. noise interfere). To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework: 1) dividing each video into multiple equal-length segments, where the local spatio-temporal features extracted; 2) concatenating combinatorial sparse activity dictionaries, formed by over-complete dictionary of each segment; 3) computing combinatorial sparse coefficients of each segment, based on activity dictionaries above; 4) formulating probability of each activity to estimate the correct class.

Everyone is cautious of the power supply they are purchasing from the utility because the end-user sensitive equipment may malfunction or trip as a result ofPQDs. In order to get a clean and disturbance free power supply, the utility needs to identify the type of disturbance, the cause of the disturbance, and mitigate it. This paper presents a novel approach for classifying the commonly occurring PQDs like sag, swell, and interruption. The proposed algorithm is realized by generating voltage signals pertaining to the PQDs using integral mathematical models, Simulink models, and experimentation. The voltage signals related to different PQDs are processed using HT and the processed signals having elliptical shapes are plotted and converted into images. These images are further processed using the image processing technique in order to turn the RGB image into a grayscale image. The statistical parameters namely mean and standard deviation are calculated from the grayscale image input to the algorithm for feature extraction. The KNN classifier is trained and tested using these extracted features. In the KNN classifier, the minimum Euclidean distance is calculated to identify the class of PQDs with high accuracy.","","978-1-6654-6112-2","10.1109/ICETEMS56252.2022.10093403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093403","Hilbert Transform.

Applications that depend on an IP similarity measure include measuring correlation between security alerts, building baselines for behavioral modelling, debugging network failures and tracking persistent attacks. However, IPs do not have a natural similarity measure by definition. Deep Learning architectures are a promising solution here since they are able to learn numerical representations for IPs directly from data, allowing various distance measures to be applied on the calculated representations. Current works have utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for learning IP embeddings. However, these approaches have no systematic way to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) IPs not seen during training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for IP embedding using an adapted graph neural network (GNN) architecture. This approach has the advantages of working on the raw data, scalability and, most importantly, induction, i.e. the ability to measure similarity between previously unseen IPs. Using data from an enterprise network, our approach is able to identify high similarities between local DNS servers and root DNS servers even though some of these machines are never encountered during the training phase.","","978-1-7281-9486-8","10.1109/CloudNet51028.2020.9335789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9335789","","Training;Current measurement;Natural language processing;Graph neural networks;IP networks;Servers;Task analysis","","1","","21","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, a qualitative readout by visual tracking is more difficult as well. Non-rigid registration can be used to compensate for these movements in the image series. Because of the local contrast and intensity change over time, the registration criterion needs to be chosen carefully. We propose a measure based on Normalized Gradient Fields (NGF) in order to obtain registration. Since this measure requires strong gradients in the images, we also test combining the measure with the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) to maintain registration forces over the whole image area. To ensure smoothness, we employ a Laplacian regularizer and use the B-spline based approach to describe the transformation of the image space. Our experiments show that by using NGF good registration results can be obtained for image exhibiting a high intensity contrast. For images with a low intensity contrast, combining NGF and SSD improves the registration results significantly over using NGF only. Both measures are differentiable making possible the application of fast, gradient based optimizers.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-1814-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4649933","","","Algorithms;Automatic Data Processing;Automation;Contrast Media;Gadolinium;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Statistical;Motion;Myocardium;Perfusion;Reproducibility of Results;Respiration;Software","7","","9","IEEE","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interface similarity is a kind of replication that refers to the similarity of method names, return types and parameter types which repeat across the code repositories. Two methods with similar interfaces are prone to be cloned if those perform analogous functions either entirely or at least partially. An exploratory study is performed in this paper, to explore the relationship and effects of interface similarity in code clones. It is investigated that interface similarity can be helpful for code clone detection. First, clone methods are detected in code repositories. Then, interface information is extracted from source code and several interface similarities are measured using that information. The experimental corpus contains three different types of code repositories with 35, 109 and 24,558 Java projects respectively. The detected clone pairs in three code repositories are, on average 57,457, 102,745 and 123,576 respectively. Promising results are found as it shows on average 87.91% intra-project and 59.17% inter-project clones contain similar interfaces (i.e., return types and at least one keyword and one parameter type are similar). Besides, the average similarity of interfaces in Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 clones are 100%, 83.47% and 81.90% respectively. These results prove the strong relationship between code clones and interface similarities. In future, it can be useful to design and develop interface driven clone detection tools.","","978-1-5386-2649-8","10.1109/APSECW.2017.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8312535","Code Clone;Clone Detection;Exploratory Study","Cloning;Java;Tools;Data mining;Information technology;Electronic mail;Benchmark testing","","6","","25","IEEE","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A hierarchical model is generated solely based on the geometry information of a 3D CAD model of the object. The approach does not rely on texture or reflectance information of the object's surface, making it useful for a wide range of industrial and robotic applications, e.g., bin-picking. A hierarchical view-based approach that addresses typical problems of previous methods is applied: It handles true perspective, is robust to noise, occlusions, and clutter to an extent that is sufficient for many practical applications, and is invariant to contrast changes. For the generation of this hierarchical model, a new model image generation technique by which scale-space effects can be taken into account is presented. The necessary object views are derived using a similarity-based aspect graph. The high robustness of an exhaustive search is combined with an efficient hierarchical search. The 3D pose is refined by using a least-squares adjustment that minimizes geometric distances in the image, yielding a position accuracy of up to 0.12 percent with respect to the object distance, and an orientation accuracy of up to 0.35 degree in our tests. The recognition time is largely independent of the complexity of the object, but depends mainly on the range of poses within which the object may appear in front of the camera. For efficiency reasons, the approach allows the restriction of the pose range depending on the application. Typical runtimes are in the range of a few hundred ms.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112769","3D object recognition;machine vision;aspect graphs;similarity measures;hierarchical;models;robotics;industrial automation;image generation;projections;shape;feature measurement;least squares methods;perspective.","Solid modeling;Three dimensional displays;Cameras;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Robustness;Design automation","","111","1","46","IEEE","27 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Medical image registration relies on similarity measure which is low between PET/CT image voxels and therefore PET/CT registration is a challenging task. To address this issue, this paper presents an unsupervised end-to-end method, DenseRegNet, for deformable 3D PET/CT image registration. The method consists of two stages: (1) predicting 3D displacement vector field (DVF); and (2) registering 3D image. In the 3D DVF prediction stage, a two-level similarity measure together with a deformation regularization is proposed as loss function to optimize network training.In the image registration stage, a resampler and a spatial transformer are utilized to obtain the registration results. In this paper, 663 pairs of Uptake Value (SUV) and Hounsfield Unit (Hu) patches of 106 patients, 227 pairs of SUV and Hu patches of 35 patients and 259 pairs of SUV and Hu patches of 35 patients are randomly selected as training, validation and test set, respectively. Normalized cross correlation (NCC), intersection over union (IoU) of liver bounding box and euclidean distance (ED) on landmark points are used to evaluate the registration results. Experiment results show that the proposed method, DenseRegNet, achieves the best results in terms of liver bounding box IoU and ED, and the second highest value of NCC. For a trained model, given a new pair of PET/CT images, the registration result can be obtained with only one forward calculation within 10 seconds. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that, compared with other deep learning registration models, the proposed DenseRegNet achieves improved results in the challenging deformable PET/CT registration task.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961268","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872075); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(grant numbers:26108005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937543","PET/CT registration;unsupervised learning;two-level similarity measure;deformation regularization","Three-dimensional displays;Computed tomography;Image registration;Task analysis;Strain;Biomedical imaging;Training","","9","","29","CCBY","20 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we train and calculate the vector representation of all companies by graph embedding model. Finally, we define the cosine distance of the vector as the similarity of the companies. The embedding vector of companies obtained by the industrial chain graph has achieved good results in link prediction task, visualization and practical application of stock portfolio, and the graph with weight has better effect than that without weight., the back test results show that the stock portfolio has obtained considerable extra-return.","","978-1-6654-4374-6","10.1109/SmartCloud52277.2021.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627188","industrial chain knowledge graph;graph embedding;similarity stock;stock portfolio","Industries;Visualization;Correlation;Companies;Production;Share prices;Task analysis","","3","","51","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the recently proposed systems, with heterogeneous features (such as audio and video), the joint sparse optimization problem was addressed by bringing the features into the same dynamic range, such as normalizing the features into unitl2 norm. This is however not optimal, and such normalization may decrease the performance of that modality unimodally. We propose to solve the original joint sparse optimization problem by introducing scaling factors for different modalities, such that the modalities interact efficiently at the feature level. The sequence-dependent scaling factors are automatically calculated so that the mismatch between the sparse representations of different modalities is accounted for. In the case of audiovisual recognition system, our experiments on the challenging MOBIO database show that the proposed method outperforms the original joint sparsity-based system (96.8% vs 94.3% recognition rate).","2157-4774","978-1-5386-6536-7","10.1109/WIFS.2018.8630775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8630775","","Dictionaries;Optimization;Face;Feature extraction;Training;Australia;Dynamic range","","3","","28","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this way, the trained model predicts the GFD distance of graphs directly rather than constructs a GFD vector by counting graphlets as in traditional methods. A experimental evaluation is conducted to validate the effectiveness of our model in real-world networks scaled from tens of nodes to thousands of nodes.

Here the observed input value A' does not have to exactly match the antecedent value A in order to produce the output B' which does not have to exactly match B. This paper examines the traditional fuzzy inferencing method for fuzzy control that is similarity-based and uses Zadeh's consistency or partial matching index and distance-based methods, one referred to as geometric compatibility modification (GCM) and the other transformation constraint-based generalized modus ponens (T-CGMP).

To use LC-KSVD, one key issue is how to extract feature vectors from 3D ear scans. To this end, we propose a block-wise statistics based scheme. Specifically, we divide a 3D ear ROI into blocks and extract a histogram of surface types from each block; histograms from all blocks are concatenated to form the desired feature vector. Feature vectors extracted in this way are highly discriminative and are robust to mere misalignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve much better recognition accuracy than the other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, its computational complexity is extremely low at the classification stage.","1945-788X","978-1-4799-7082-7","10.1109/ICME.2015.7177475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7177475","3D ear;surface type;local histogram;LC-KSVD;sparse representation","Ear;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Dictionaries;Histograms;Robustness;Training","","","","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is observed that the sparse representation alone is less effective in the R-D performance due to the side information overhead at higher bit rates. To overcome this problem, the DCT representation is cascaded at the second stage. It is applied to the remaining signal to improve coding efficiency.

To deal with data uncertainty, probabilistic databases can be used to store uncertain data, and querying facilities are provided to yield answers with confidence. However, the results from a query or mining process may not be reliable when the uncertainty propagates in the systems. In this paper, we leverage the power of crowdsourcing by designing a set of Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs in short, to ask a crowd to improve the quality of uncertain data. In particular, we consider crowds consists of workers with diverse accuracy rates when answering the HITs. We design solutions to maximize the data quality with minimal number of HITs. There are two obstacles for this non-trivial optimization, which lead to very high computational cost for selecting the optimal set of HITs. First, members of a crowd may return incorrect answers with different probabilities. Second, the HITs decomposed from uncertain data are often correlated. We have addressed these challenges in this paper by designing an effective approximation algorithm and an efficient heuristic solution, especially for crowds with diverse individual accuracy rates. To further improve the efficiency, we derive tight lower and upper bounds for effective filtering and estimation. Extensive experiments on both a simulated crowd and a real crowdsourcing platform are conducted to evaluate our solutions.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.3027545","Hong Kong RGC GRF(grant numbers:16202218,C6030-18G,C1031-18G,C5026-18G); AOE(grant numbers:AoE/E-603/18); China NSFC(grant numbers:61729201,61806132); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B151530001); Hong Kong ITC ITF(grant numbers:ITS/044/18FX,ITS/470/18FX); Microsoft Research Asia Collaborative Research; Didi-HKUST joint research lab; Shenzhen University; Tencent Rhino-Bird Young Faculty Open Fund; Wechat; Webank Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210063","Crowdsourcing;cleaning uncertain data;approximation algorithm;heuristic algorithm","Crowdsourcing;Cleaning;Uncertainty;Data integrity;Approximation algorithms;Urban areas;Databases","","3","","45","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whenever an array element is accessed, a cmp (compare) instruction is executed to check whether the index value is within the valid bounds. Array bounds checks may prevent many useful optimizations because of precise exception. We present a new ABCE (Array Bounds Check Elimination) algorithm to eliminate redundant checks based on sparse representation for a Java static compiler. In contrast to other approaches performing in JVMs, we adhere to the design principle of the static compiler to optimize scientific Java applications. The algorithm is a light-weight algorithm working on an intermediate representation in Static Single Assignment form. It fully removes bounds checks if it can be proven that they never fail. Whenever possible, it moves bounds checks out of loops to reduce the total number of executed checks. If such a check fails, the executing program branches into the unmodified loop to preserve the exception semantics of Java. For the scientific SciMark 2.0 benchmark suite, this algorithm removes on average 76% of bounds check instructions. The evaluation shows a speedup near to the theoretical maximum for LU test case.","","978-0-7695-3903-4","10.1109/SERA.2009.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381765","Java;array bounds check elimination;optimization;performance","Java;Partial response channels;Runtime;Phased arrays;Software engineering;Conference management;Engineering management;Application software;Parallel processing;Design optimization","","","","13","IEEE","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a reconstruction can be obtained from motion data by comparing the trajectory segments and estimating both the spatial and temporal alignments. Exhaustive testing of all possible correspondences of trajectories over a temporal window is only viable in the cases with a limited number of moving targets and large view overlaps. Therefore, alternative solutions are required for situations with several trajectories that are only partially visible in each view. In this paper, we propose a new method that is based on view-invariant representation of trajectories, which is used to produce a sparse set of salient points for trajectory segments observed in each view. Only the neighborhoods at these salient points in the view-invariant representation are then used to estimate the spatial and temporal alignment of trajectory pairs in different views. It is demonstrated that, for planar scenes, the method is able to recover with good precision and efficiency both spatial and temporal alignments, even given relatively small overlap between views and arbitrary (unknown) temporal shifts of the cameras. The method also provides the same capabilities in the case of trajectories that are only locally planar, but exhibit some nonplanarity at a global level.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4775905","Registration;invariants;similarity measures;cross ratio.","Video sequences;Cameras;Trajectory;Layout;Geometry;Motion estimation;Testing;Surveillance;Computer vision;Software","","6","","27","IEEE","6 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In nature, diversity at the genetic level helps ensure survival of a species, and provides resilience to some individuals against certain pathogens. While diversity has been explored at the software level, its applicability to hardware is less obvious. This paper explores the application of mutating hardware, inspired by evolution in nature, to Field Programmable Gate Arrays, and provides examples of low-overhead modifications to a typical FPGA architecture that enables secure, mutating architectures for current- and next-generation FPGAs.","","978-1-5386-6544-2","10.1109/IVSW.2018.8494854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8494854","FPGA;Hardware;Architecture;Diversity","Field programmable gate arrays;Security;Hardware;Table lookup;Tools;IP networks","","1","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation results show that the intrinsic characteristics of application protocols, of the TCP transport protocol, and of user and network profiles affect the traffic self-similar characteristics in distinct ways. Experimental results also reveal that different quantities of contribution from different application protocols in the traffic load can also change traffic's self-similar characteristics.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2005.1642430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642430","FTP;http;Self-similarity;SMTP;TCP","Electronic mail;Programmable control;Hardware;DC motors;Irrigation;Choppers;IEC;Ethernet networks;Software testing;Impedance","","","","19","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To better explore the behavioral features, we define a fine-grained classification of behavioral events and introduce self-similarity to quantify the repeatability of behavioral sequence. We leverage five machine learning classifiers on the benchmark dataset to conduct bot detection, and finally choose random forest as the classifier, which achieves the highest F1-score of 95.83%.

We recognize that the first step to bridge this performance gap is to understand the the architectural execution characteristics of Javascript benchmarks. Therefore, this paper presents an in-depth architectural characterization of widely used V8 and Sunspider Javascript benchmarks using Google's V8 javascript engine. Using statistical data analysis techniques, our characterization study discovers and explains correlation among different execution characteristics in microarchitecture dependent as well as microarchitecture independent fashion. Furthermore, our study measures (dis)similarity among 33 different Javascript benchmarks and discusses its implications.

This architecture is also called Manhattan LSTM, which can be applied to the case of detecting paraphrase sentences. The paraphrase sentence must be recognized by machine learning first. Word2vec is used to convert sentences to vectors so they can be recognized in machine learning. This research has developed paraphrase sentence detection using Siamese Similarity with word2vec embedding.

Frequent pattern mining techniques are extensively studied in numerous domains, including market basket data analysis, data mining, recommender system, web log mining, sequential pattern mining, and software bug detection. In frequent itemset mining, the support-based framework is frequently used to find itemsets with a frequency over a predetermined threshold. Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat, FP-Max, SaM and Relim are a few of the FPM algorithms that have been created to efficiently search for frequent itemsets in datasets. While FP-Growth utilizes a tree-based approach and does not require candidate generation, the Apriori method generates candidate itemsets using a level- wise search strategy and the Apriori property. Eclat employs an equivalence class clustering and lattice traversal technique, while FP-Max focuses on mining maximal frequent itemsets. Relim is a list-based, result-driven mining technique, while SaM is used to mine associative rules. A review and comparison of numerous frequent pattern mining algorithms, including Apriori, FP- growth, Eclat, FP-max, COFI, SaM, and ReLim, are presented in this paper. Using a variety of real-time datasets with unique properties, we provide an in-depth study of these frequent itemset mining algorithms. The algorithms are evaluated according to factors such as the total number of database scans needed, candidate generation techniques, and sensitivity to changes in user-defined parameters like support. Real-life datasets including Chess, Retail, Kaggle, Market Basket, and Technical datasets, are used for the analysis. The results emphasize each algorithm’s insights into how effective and efficient each algorithm is. The objective of the present research is to increase effectiveness and efficiency frequent pattern mining algorithms.

Followed by, the self-regulating inertia weight is leveraged to strike a balance between the exploration and exploitation in the search space. After that, three different kinds of mutation strategies (gaussian, cauchy and chaotic mutations) are used to maintain the potential diversity of the whole swarm based on an effective diversity-guided mechanism. In particular, an auxiliary velocity-position update mechanism is exclusively applied to the global best particle that can effectively guarantee the convergence of the DMPSO. Finally, extensive experiments on a set of well-known unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions demonstrate that DMPSO outperforms most of the other tested PSO variants in terms of both the solution quality and its efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2938063","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2013CB329502); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971005); Tianchenghuizhi Fund for Innovation and Promotion of Education(grant numbers:2018A03036); Key Research and Development Program of the Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2018GY-037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8817908","Particle swarm optimization;opposition-based learning;swarm diversity;inertial weight;premature convergence;local optima;mutation strategy","Convergence;Particle swarm optimization;Acceleration;Sociology;Statistics;Standards;Chaos","","19","","81","CCBY","28 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the complex properties inside or between heterogeneous objects, multiple local metrics become an essential representation tool to depict various local characteristics of examples. Different from existing methods building more than one local metric directly, however in this paper, we emphasize the effect of the global metric when generating those local ones. Since local metrics can be considered as types of amendments which describe the biases towards localities based on some commonly shared characteristic, it is expected that the performance of every single local metric for a specified locality can be “lifted” when learning with the global jointly. Following this consideration, we propose the Local metrIcs Facilitated Transformation (Lift) framework, where an adaptive number of local transformations are constructed with the help of their global counterpart. Generalization analyses not only reveal the relationship between the global and local metrics but also indicate when and why the framework works theoretically. In the implementation of Lift, locality anchored centers assist the decomposition of multiple local views, and a diversity regularizer is proposed to reduce the redundancy among biases. Empirical classification comparisons reveal the superiority of the Lift idea. Numerical and visualization investigations on different domains validate its adaptability and comprehensibility as well.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2901675","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773198,61632004); NSFC-NRF(grant numbers:61861146001); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653339","Distance metric learning;similarity measures;multi-metric learning;global and local;generalization analysis","Redundancy;Euclidean distance;Task analysis;Training;Complexity theory;Semantics","","14","","51","IEEE","26 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The elastic net has a grouping effect and is more suitable for real-world data. The gradient is very important information in the image, we also use image gradient to enhance the final output.

Dictionary-based sparse representation has been widely studied recently due to its ability to extract inherent image structures. Meantime, it can extract image features with slightly higher level semantics. Intuitively, sparse representation can be used for image quality assessment, because visible distortions can cause significant changes to the sparse features. In this paper, a new sparse representation-based image quality assessment model is proposed based on the construction of adaptive sub-dictionaries. An over-complete dictionary trained from natural images is employed to capture the structure changes between the reference and distorted images by sparse feature extraction via adaptive sub-dictionary selection. Based on the observation that image sparse features are invariant to weak degradations and the perceived image quality is generally influenced by diverse issues, three auxiliary quality features are added, including gradient, color, and luminance information. The proposed method is not sensitive to training images, so a universal dictionary can be adopted for quality evaluation. Extensive experiments on five public image quality databases demonstrate that the proposed method produces the state-of-the-art results, and it delivers consistently well performances when tested in different image quality databases.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2577891","Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2015QNA66); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61379143); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486021","Quality evaluation;overcomplete synthesis dictionary;sparse coding;adaptive sub-dictionary;Quality evaluation;overcomplete synthesis dictionary;sparse coding;adaptive sub-dictionary","Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Measurement;Distortion;Image quality;Visualization;Computational modeling","","22","","49","IEEE","7 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this field, the use of three-dimensional (3D) ear shape is a recent trend. As a biometric identifier, the ear has several inherent merits. However, although a great deal of efforts have been devoted, there is still large room for improvement in developing a highly effective and efficient 3D ear identification approach. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap to some extent by proposing a novel 3D ear classification scheme that makes use of the label consistent K-SVD (LC-KSVD) framework. As an effective supervised dictionary learning algorithm, LC-KSVD learns a single compact discriminative dictionary for sparse coding and a multi-class linear classifier simultaneously. To use the LC-KSVD framework, one key issue is how to extract feature vectors from 3D ear scans. To this end, we propose a blockwise statistics-based feature extraction scheme. Specifically, we divide a 3D ear region of interest into uniform blocks and extract a histogram of surface types from each block; histograms from all blocks are then concatenated to form the desired feature vector. Feature vectors extracted in this way are highly discriminative and are robust to mere misalignment between samples. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve better recognition accuracy than the other state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, its computational complexity is extremely low, making it quite suitable for the large-scale identification applications.

Note that each variant has very weak correlation signal to neuroimaging measures or Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. Therefore, traditional sparse regression-based image genetics approaches confront with unresolvable features, relative high regression error or inapplicability of high-dimensional data. Adopting an $\text{L}_0$ regularization method, we significantly elevate the regression accuracy of imaging genetics compared with group-sparse multitask regression method. With further analysis on the simulation results, we conclude that multiple regression tasks model may be unsuitable for image genetics. In addition, we carried out a whole genome association analysis between genetic variants (about 388 million loci) and phenotypes (cognition normal, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease) with using the $\text{L}_0$ regularization method. After annotating the effect of all variants by Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), our method locates 33 missense variants which can explain 40% phenotype variance.

Algorithms that deal with PDN matrices should provide stability to the system, yet process data fast and efficiently, utilizing the existing hardware architecture to the maximum. The algorithms that deal with PDN data are based on factorization of sparse matrices, where pivoting strategy may destabilize the system. The algorithms used in commercial software ensure the system stability, but are complex and hard to implement. In this paper, we propose the usage of partial diagonal pivoting, with minimum degree ordering for matrix factorization in the domain of PDN applications.

In population-based optimization methods, the generation of diverse individuals holds utmost importance for adequately exploring the problem landscape, particularly in highly multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems. Our study reveals that, in line with findings from sev-eral prior research papers, commonly employed crossover and mutation operations lack the capability to generate high-quality diverse individuals and tend to become confined to limited areas around various local optima. This paper introduces an augmen-tation to the diversity of the population in the well-established multi-objective scheme of the genetic algorithm, NSGA-II. This enhancement is achieved through two key components: the genuine initialization method and the substitution of the worst individuals with new randomly generated individuals as a re-initialization approach in each generation. The proposed multi-objective feature selection method undergoes testing on twelve real-world classification problems, with the number of features ranging from 2,400 to nearly 50,000. The results demonstrate that replacing the last front of the population with an equivalent number of new random individuals generated using the genuine initialization method and featuring a limited number of features substantially improves the population's quality and, consequently, enhances the performance of the multi-objective algorithm.","","979-8-3503-0836-5","10.1109/CEC60901.2024.10612084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10612084","","Sociology;Pipelines;Optimization methods;Evolutionary computation;Feature extraction;Data models;Distance measurement","","","","40","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is puzzling since academic security researchers have published scores of papers claiming to advance the state of the art in the area of code randomization. Unfortunately, these improved diversity techniques are generally less deployable than integrity-based techniques, such as control-flow integrity, due to their limited compatibility with existing optimization, development, and distribution practices. This paper contributes yet another diversity technique called pagerando. Rather than trading off practicality for security, we first and foremost aim for deployability and interoperability. Most code randomization techniques interfere with memory sharing and deduplication optimization across processes and virtual machines, ours does not. We randomize at the granularity of individual code pages but never rewrite page contents. This also avoids incompatibilities with code integrity mechanisms that only allow signed code to be mapped into memory and prevent any subsequent changes. On Android, pagerando fully adheres to the default SELinux policies. All practical mitigations must interoperate with unprotected legacy code, our implementation transparently interoperates with unmodified applications and libraries.

The very early works in the 1990s mostly focus on estimating geometric deformations of facial landmarks to address this task. While in the past several years, more and more efforts have been made to directly learn an appearance regression for facial analysis. Though training regressions on controlled facial images can successfully capture the appearance variations, the performance of these appearance-based models are tightly related to the quantity and quality of the training data. In this paper, we develop a novel framework, named geometric correlated landmark regression (GCLR), to inherit the advantages but overcome limitations of these two categories of methods. Specifically, we first establish a landmark-to-landmark regression to estimate the geometry of facial images. By further incorporating a sparse coding term into the regression framework, we can successfully leverage the geometric correlations between the test image and the shape dictionary, thus significantly enhance the geometry regression performance. Experimental results on various challenging facial data sets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of GCLR.","1945-788X","978-1-5090-6067-2","10.1109/ICME.2017.8019469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8019469","Facial landmark;Regression;Face transfer;Sparse coding","Training;Correlation;Shape;Face;Geometry;Databases;Encoding","","1","","27","IEEE","31 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe a light-weight, automatic debugging-based technique, coined extended spectrum-based fault localization for MAS (ESFL-MAS), that shortens the diagnostic process, while only relying on minimal information about the system. ESFL-MAS uses a heuristic that quantifies the suspiciousness of an agent to be faulty. Different heuristics may have a different impact on the diagnostic quality of ESFL-MAS. Our experimental evaluation shows that 10 out of 42 heuristics (namely accuracy, coverage, Jaccard, Laplace, least contradiction, Ochiai, Rogers and Tanimoto, simple-matching, Sorensen-dice, and support) yield the best diagnostic accuracy (96.26% on average) in the context of the MAS used in our experiments.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2523905","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; Portuguese Agency for Research and Development(grant numbers:SFRH/BD/66717/2009); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Brazilian Agency for Research and Development(grant numbers:BEX 9382-13-5); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458176","Fault diagnosis;multiagent systems (MASs);reliability;spectrum-based fault localization (SFL)","Java;Context;Software;Multi-agent systems;Fault diagnosis","","2","","48","IEEE","22 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we clean and organize defect-related knowledge, defining concepts of defect entities, attributes, and relationships to establish a code defect knowledge graph. Next, using abstract syntax trees, we extract various information from the code, including control flow diagrams, control dependency graphs, data dependency graphs, program dependency graphs, and code attribute graphs, to capture relevant details about nodes and edges. Based on the structural and logical information represented by node-edge associations, we employ the Deepwalk algorithm to construct a directed graph of the code and generate random walk sequences. These sequences serve as a foundation for learning and vector representation. Finally, we compare the vector similarities between the generated representations and a candidate code list from the defect knowledge graph, which has undergone initial semantic threshold filtering. By querying the defect labels of the most similar code in the defect code knowledge graph, we determine whether the code under inspection contains defects. Experimental results reveal that DDMB improves defect detection accuracy by 2.02% compared to existing methods. Additionally, it enhances the interpretability and reliability of defect detection while facilitating multi-dimensional analysis of code defects, thus providing better support for practical applications.","2837-7109","979-8-3503-1725-1","10.1109/ICCC59590.2023.10507664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10507664","knowledge graph;deepwalk;defect detection;DDMB;code similarity","Software testing;Codes;Semantics;Knowledge graphs;Static analysis;Syntactics;Vectors","","","","26","IEEE","30 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate their limitations, this paper proposes a clustering-based similarity measurement method for ESTO, aiming to accurately select promising source solutions to speed up the evolutionary search in solving TOPs. Specifically, all candidate source TOPs that have been optimized are first categorized into different clusters based on their populations via k-means clustering. Afterward, the populations of source TOPs in the same cluster are employed to compute the similarity of these source TOPs to the target TOP that is being optimized. In this way, the TOPs with the highest similarity can be identified and their optimized solutions will be injected into the population of the target task for faster convergence. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches, thereby confirming its capability to improve the optimization performance and efficiency in solving practical TOPs.","","979-8-3503-5409-6","10.1109/CAI59869.2024.00229","Hong Kong Polytechnic University; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10605476","Evolutionary sequential transfer optimization;similarity measurement;trajectory optimization problems","Sociology;Search problems;Task analysis;Statistics;Artificial intelligence;Trajectory optimization;Convergence","","","","36","IEEE","30 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many techniques have been proposed in the literature, but majority of these performs analysis in frequency domain, applying additional transformation or preprocessing methods. In this paper, a novel methodology to detect a half-broken bar fault is proposed, making use of the vibration signal from induction motor under two fault conditions: healthy and half-broken bar; and three load conditions: unloaded, half-loaded and three-fourths loaded. The detection is possible due to the sparse representation of the raw signal which is obtained and then evaluated by minimal decomposition error criterion. In this way, preprocessing methods are not needed, and the fault is detected early and directly.
