For the electric arc detection, previous recognition on different arc properties or different forming sources can help to achieve this work. This paper thus propose an idea by using similarity measurement to find the relevance between produced arc signal and the source of arc.

In this study, an intelligent detection framework with the discriminative Stein kernel-based sparse representation (DSK-SR) is constructed to distinguish epileptic EEG signals. Specifically, in the scheme of DSK-SR, EEG samples are presented by symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices in the form of covariance descriptors (CovDs). Taking into account the non-Euclidean geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices, the traditional SR in Euclidean space cannot be applied in its original form on the manifold. To this end, the DSK defined on the manifold can permit us to embed the manifold into a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to perform SR. Then, test samples are sparsely coded over the training sets, and the classification decision is performed by assessing which class generates the minimal reconstructed residuals. Eventually, competitive experimental results on three widely recognized EEG datasets against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed DSK-SR in identifying epileptic EEG signals, indicating its powerful application potential in the automatic seizure detection.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3137159","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632014,61627808,61210010); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2014CB744600); Program of Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission(grant numbers:Z171100000117005); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:lzujbky-2020-kb25); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656882","Discriminative Stein kernel (DSK);electroencephalogram (EEG);seizure detection;sparse representation (SR);symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix","Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Kernel;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Sparse matrices;Manifolds;Covariance matrices","","8","","66","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given triplets like “aircraft” is similar to “bird” than “train”, Weakly Supervised Conditional Similarity Learning (WS-CSL) learns multiple embeddings to match semantic conditions without explicit condition labels such as “can fly”. However, similarity relationships in a triplet are uncertain except providing a condition. For example, the previous comparison becomes invalid once the conditional label changes to “is vehicle”. To this end, we introduce a novel evaluation criterion by predicting the comparison's correctness after assigning the learned embeddings to their optimal conditions, which measures how much WS-CSL could cover latent semantics as the supervised model. Furthermore, we propose the Distance Induced Semantic COndition VER-ification Network (DiscoverNet), which characterizes the instance-instance and triplets-condition relations in a “decompose-and-fuse” manner. To make the learned embeddings cover all semantics, Discovernet utilizes a set module or an additional regularizer over the correspondence between a triplet and a condition.

Methods: We construct the similarity graph using embedded features of the input image (i.e., Non-Demented (ND), Very Mild Demented (VMD), Mild Demented (MD), and Moderated Demented (MDTD)). We experiment and compare different dimension-reduction and clustering algorithms to construct the best similarity graph to capture the similarity between the same class images using the cosine distance as a similarity measure. We utilize the similarity graph to present (sample) the training data to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use the similarity graph as a regularizer in the loss function of a CNN model to minimize the distance between the input images and their k-nearest neighbours in the similarity graph while minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss between the training image predictions and the actual image class labels. Results: We conduct a baseline experiment with a standard, none-tuned VGG-19 CNN model with different settings and compare the results to identify the best settings to classify (ND vs VMD vs MD vs MDTD). Conclusion: Our method achieves an adequate performance on the testing dataset (accuracy = 0.71, area under receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.86, F1 measure = 0.71). Significance: The classification results show that utilizing a structural similarity graph with none tuned standard CNN model can achieve adequate prediction accuracy and motivate fine-tuning several pre-trained models for better classification performance.","","978-1-6654-3875-9","10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9599144","Alzheimer's Disease;Convolutional Neural Network;Graph-Regularization;Magnetic Resonance Images;Learning Structural Similarity","Training;Magnetic resonance;Training data;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease","","3","","28","IEEE","17 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the results of detecting the community were found to be random when using LPA. Based on previous improvements to the LPA, this article proposes a new LPA (NOHLPA) that joins multilayer neighborhood overlap and historical label similarity. The NOHLPA considers both the node update order and label selection rules. We cited the label entropy as the basis for node update order and defined multilayer neighborhood overlap and historical label similarity for calculating node preferences to devise more appropriate label selection rules.

This reduces the probability of signal detection at an adversarial receiver. Moreover, random sequence selection and time-dithering are both proven to be potent methods for reducing cyclic correlations and can combine to provide a 94.6% reduction in DCS at the receiver. To facilitate communication with asynchronous SDRs several post-correction measures are described which enable demodulation of the received data. These are tested and shown to be effective even in the absence of an explicit preamble, which is critical to maintain the LPD nature of the communication signal.","","978-1-946815-19-4","10.23919/USNC-URSINRSM60317.2024.10464567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10464567","","Wireless communication;Measurement;Correlation;Feature detection;Receivers;Signal detection;Software radio","","","","3","","21 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wikis among other information-oriented platforms are experiencing an increasing attention for informal learning, especially Wikipedia. Link-based navigation and keyword-based search methods used on wiki environments suffer from many limitations. To support informal learning on these environments, it is important to provide easy and fast access to relevant content. However, the massive diversity of unstructured content and user base on these environments pose major challenges when designing recommendation models. To the best of our knowledge, no effective personalized content recommendation approach has yet been defined to support informal learning on wikis. We propose an effective personalized content recommendation framework (PCRF) in addition to an evaluation framework that can be used to evaluate the impact of personalized content recommendations on informal learning from wikis. PCRF implements an efficient structural recommendation model by integrating fuzzy thesauri with adaptive users' interest models generated using structural analysis of topical navigational graphs. We design user studies with multiple strategies and treatments to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework and assess the impact of recommendations on informal learning. Experiments show that PCRF generates highly relevant recommendations adaptive to changes in users' interests using the HARD model with MAP@k scores 86.4-100%. An evaluation of informal learning revealed that users of Wikipedia with personalized support could achieve higher scores on a conceptual knowledge assessment with an average score of 14.9 compared with 10.0 for users who used the encyclopedia without recommendations.

Additionally, we design a loss function that clusters similar categories and discriminates between old and new tasks in the feature space. The proposed method requires only a small number of extra parameters, which are negligible in comparison to the increasing number of tasks. We perform extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet100, and ImageNet1000 datasets, which demonstrate that our method outperforms other competitive methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, it is still a challenge to detect unknown attacks. Currently, there are two main methods of unknown attack detection: clustering and honeypot. But they still have unsolved problems such as difficulty in collecting unknown attack samples and failure to detect on time. Zero-Shot learning is proposed to deal with the problem in this article, which can recognize unknown attacks by learning the mapping relations between feature space and semantic space (such as attribute space). When the semantic descriptions of all attacks (including known and unknown attacks) are provided, the classifier built by Zero-Shot learning can extract common semantic information among all attacks and construct connections between known and unknown attacks. The classifier then utilizes the connections to classify unknown attacks although there are no samples for unknown attacks. In this article, we first propose to use Zero-Shot learning to overcome the challenge of unknown attack detection and illustrate the feasibility of this method. Secondly, we then propose a novel method of Zero-Shot learning based on sparse autoencoder for unknown attack detection. This method maps the feature of known attacks to the semantic space, and restores the semantic space to the feature space by constrains of reconstruction error, and establishes the feature to semantic mapping, which is used to detect unknown attacks. Verification tests have been carried out by using the public dataset NSL_KDD. From the experiments conducted in this work, the results show that the average accuracy reaches 88.3%, which performs better than other methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033494","Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2018GZDZX0006,2019YFG0399,2017GZDZX0002,20ZDYF0091); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41774095); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239385","Zero-shot learning;network intrusion;unknown attack detection;sparse semantic autoencoder","Semantics;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Training;Network intrusion detection;Data mining","","27","","42","CCBY","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods have adopted pre-trained language models (PLMs) and achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, due to the Dropout strategy, the PLM-based models suffer from inconsistency between the training and testing stages, i.e., the semantic representation during training is inconsistent with the counterpart during testing. Besides, the PLM-based models prefer to correct the erroneous characters to semantically proper or commonly used ones rather than the ground truths. And they usually neglect phonological and visual similarity knowledge between characters. In this paper, we propose a consistent and contrastive learning approach with character similarity for CSC (CCCSpell). CCCSpell is composed of a BERT-based detector and a character similarity-based corrector. The detector uses bidirectional Kullback-Leibler divergence to minimize the gap between the output distributions of two sub-models sampled by Dropout, which can enhance the consistency of the semantic representations when training and inferring to improve the testing performance. Besides, the detector employs a contrastive optimization objective to increase the confidence of targets and decrease the counterpart of common characters, which can help avoid predicting common ones. After that, the corrector tries to incorporate phonological and visual similarity knowledge into detection results by calculating the levenshtein edit distance between the shape/pronunciation representations of characters, and utilizes the confusion set to help select golden characters. Experiments are conducted on SIGHAN and OCR datasets, and the results demonstrate that CCCSpell outperforms all baseline models and achieves new state-of-the-art performances.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191137","","Training;Visualization;Semantics;Optical character recognition;Neural networks;Detectors;Task analysis","","","","29","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thermal images generated thus experimentally, are then analysed using image processing technique for performance evaluation of heating quality (e.g. Uniform, Non-uniform etc.). In the pre-processing stage, the colour (R-G-B) images are extracted to three channel images (i.e. R, G and B) containing spatial pixel intensities. The images corresponding to each channel are stored as pixels values, each pixel value represents a colour intensity value. Histograms are frequency distribution (counts) of these intensity values that occur spatially. During training phase, the thermal tomographic image histogram for each channel (R, G and B) of desired heating quality are generated and stored. In testing phase, the unknown thermal tomographic image histogram is compared with trained histograms following histogram similarity method, which computes the overlapping area between the trained histogram and unknown histogram curves. The result shows that the area reaches maximum values for similar thermal images. The likeness for the similarity of the test image as captured are found out histogram similarity factors i.e. area of overlapped histogram curves, histogram-distance and skewness-kurtosis based similarity between the histograms. Heating quality (e.g. uniform or non-uniform) is then assessed based upon these found out histogram similarity factor values viz. an unknown test image has got the most similarity with that known heating class database which has got the maximum Histogram intersection percentage, minimum mean Euclidean distance between the normalised histograms and minimum mean Distance (Skewness-Kurtosis) measure.","","978-1-6654-6242-6","10.1109/CALCON56258.2022.10060021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060021","Tomography;Histogram Similarity Factors;Skewness;Kurtosis","Temperature measurement;Training;Histograms;Temperature distribution;Image color analysis;Furnaces;Tomography","","","","20","IEEE","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, the distortion measure used is either sum-of-square error or sum-of-absolute distance, both of which are convenient when used in the RDO framework but not always reflective of a perceptual visual quality. We show that SSIM can be used as the distortion metric in the RDO framework in a simple, yet effective, manner by scaling the Lagrange multiplier used in RDO based on the local variance in that region. The experimental results on the H.264/AVC reference software show that compared to traditional RDO approaches, for the same SSIM score, the proposed approach can achieve an average rate reduction of about 9% and 14% for random access and low-delay encoding configurations.

The comparison, which permits to identify similar chains of components in the systems’ block diagrams, is formalized as inexact graph matching. The comparison takes into account standardized tags as well as block properties defined by a name, a value, and a unit. Similar systems are identified with a limited computational cost. When two systems are similar, a mapping between their components and interactions can be obtained at a higher computational cost. A software prototype is implemented to perform the necessary computations, visualize the results, and accordingly select the simulation parts to reuse. The software prototype is tested with the block diagram of an autonomous electric car. Similar chains of components are successfully identified in the powertrain of a non-autonomous electric car represented in a past simulation.

It encourages target atoms to compete with each other and background atoms to collaborate in the representation. However, this method suffers from several drawbacks. In sparse representation, an overcomplete dictionary is necessary, whereas, in collaborative representation, nonnegative coefficients are required. Besides, the local dual window approach may result in impure background dictionaries obtained from the outer window. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach for HTD, referred to as the global overcomplete dictionary-based sparse and nonnegative collaborative representation (GODSNCR) detector. First, a hierarchical density clustering algorithm is used to complete the dictionary atom extraction to construct a joint overcomplete dictionary to satisfy the dictionary overcompleteness problem required for sparse representation. Second, a nonnegative constraint on the coefficient matrix and a “sum to one” constraint for the joint representation are incorporated to make it more consistent with the physical meaning. Finally, the limitation of the local dual window approach is overcome by substituting the local background dictionary with a global background dictionary.

However, such methods may lead to a suboptimal solution for small-scale data since the lack of training samples. Sparse representation stands out with its efficiency and interpretability, but its precision is not so competitive. We develop a Multi-Level Cascade Sparse Representation (ML-CSR) learning method to combine both advantages when processing small-scale data. ML-CSR is proposed using a pyramid structure to expand the training data size. It adopts two core modules, the Error-To-Feature (ETF) module, and the Generate-Adaptive-Weight (GAW) module, to further improve the precision. ML-CSR calculates the inter-layer differences by the ETF module to increase the diversity of samples and obtains adaptive weights based on the layer accuracy in the GAW module. This helps ML-CSR learn more discriminative features. State-of-the-art results on the benchmark face databases validate the effectiveness of the proposed ML-CSR. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed pyramid structure, ETF, and GAW module can improve the performance of ML-CSR.

Time series self-supervised learning has emerged as a significant area of study, aiming to uncover patterns in unlabeled data for richer information. Contrastive self-supervised learning, particularly, has gained attention for time series classification. However, it introduces inductive bias by generating positive and negative samples. Another approach involves Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are effective for various data types. However, due to their reliance on the Transformer architecture, they demand significant computational resources during the pre-training phase. Recently, inspired by the remarkable advancements achieved by convolutional networks in the domain of time series forecasting, we aspire to employ convolutional networks utilizing a strategy of mask recovery for pre-training time series models. This study introduces a novel model termed Hierarchical Sparse Convolutional Masked-Autoencoder, “HSC-MAE”, which seamlessly integrates convolutional operations with the MAE architecture to adeptly capture time series features across varying scales. Furthermore, the HSC-MAE model incorporates dedicated decoders that amalgamate global and local information, enhancing its capacity to comprehend intricate temporal patterns.

Recently, an attractive solution called “transfer learning” has received increasing attention in the remote sensing field, by transferring knowledge from source domains to help improve the learning procedure in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a sparse subspace correlation analysis-based supervised classification (SSCA-SC) method for transfer learning in hyperspectral remote sensing image classification, which is not restricted by the data dimensionality or the data acquisition sensors. Specifically, we first propose a sparse subspace correlation analysis (SSCA) method to simultaneously learn the optimal projection matrices for heterogeneous domains into a common subspace and obtain sparse reconstruction coefficients over a shared self-expressive dictionary in the derived subspace. In order to fully utilize the label information to improve the class separability, the SSCA-SC framework learns more discriminative representations for the input data by training a corresponding SSCA model for each class. As a result, the projected data belonging to the same class are maximally correlated and represented well, while those from different classes will have a low correlation. Another advantage of the SSCA-SC framework lies in the fact that it not only learns new representations for the data from different domains but it also designs a discriminative and robust classifier that properly adapts to the new representation. The proposed method was tested with three hyperspectral remote sensing data sets, and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed SSCA-SC method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2882420","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41431175,61471274,41871243,61822113,61771349); Open Research Project of the Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing(grant numbers:KLIGIP-2017B05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8574055","Canonical correlation analysis (CCA);classification;domain adaptation;hyperspectral data;latent sparse representation;remote sensing;transfer learning","Dictionaries;Learning systems;Correlation;Hyperspectral imaging;Machine learning","","15","","43","IEEE","12 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although a number of approaches have been proposed to detect CNVs from whole-genome sequencing, a direct adoption of these approaches to whole-exome sequencing will often fail because exons are separately located along a genome. Therefore, an appropriate method is needed to target the specific features of exome sequencing data. Methods: In this paper, a novel sparse model based method is proposed to discover CNVs from multiple exome sequencing data. First, exome sequencing data are represented with a penalized matrix approximation, and technical variability and random sequencing errors are assumed to follow a generalized Gaussian distribution. Second, an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is used to estimate the solution. Results: The method is tested and validated on both synthetic and real data, and compared with other approaches including CoNIFER, XHMM, and cn.MOPS. The test demonstrates that the proposed method outperform other approaches. Conclusion: The proposed sparse model can detect CNVs from exome sequencing data with high power and precision.

Unfortunately, the severe performance degradation and extra system costs caused by these methods are unacceptable in many applications. This paper presents a hardware-level, lockstep shadow thread framework to enrich the diversity of the software execution, with the facilitation from programmable hardware decoder and novel CPU support of tightly coupled shadow thread technique. Specifically, given a piece of (legacy) binary code, we first generate diversified binary versions using an offline binary rewriter and programmable hardware binary translator at runtime. Two diversified binary code images are launched as dual simultaneous threads in the hardware layer with one as the primary thread and the other one as shadow thread. Instructions from the shadow thread are not executed but just compared, and thus incur no OS side-effects. The extended CPU is able to decode instructions from both threads, and dispatch them to the next stage pipeline for a lockstep comparison. Any mismatch of the decoded instructions from the two threads caused by remotely injected binary code will be detected. Our design provides instruction set randomization (ISR) with minimal cost in performance, when compared with straightforward ISR implementation. The simulation results indicate that our framework incurs very small overheads and provides a protection against code injection attacks.","1558-1101","978-3-9815370-2-4","10.7873/DATE.2014.064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800265","","Instruction sets;Hardware;Binary codes;Benchmark testing;Decoding;Radiation detectors;Pipelines","","","","24","","21 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spirometry indexes have poor sensitivity to toxic effect of hyperbaric hyperoxia. Objective is to develop new acoustic instrumentation for revealing minimum impairments of lung function in oxygen divers. The apparatus has been designed which is based on analysis of forced expiratory tracheal noise duration (FETND). This apparatus contains acoustic sensor, input device, portable personal computer and specially designed software. 48 divers before and after single shallow water dive in oxygen closed-type breathing apparatus were tested by means of this acoustic tool. After dive a significant drop of spirometric indexes forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) over the group as a whole was found. The significant increase of individual FETND, exceeding the natural variability limit, was found in 10 subjects (20.8%). Three of them during dive had respiratory symptoms characteristic for initial manifestations of pulmonary oxygen poisoning. Two of them had essential drop of FEV1. The asymptomatic reversible increase of FETND in the rest 7 divers was interpreted as a sign of obstructive impairments caused by hidden phase of hyperbaric hyperoxia effect. Thus developed acoustic tool is useful to monitor ventilation function of lungs in military/civil divers and other persons working in harmful gas media such as firefighters, astronauts and so on.","","978-1-4244-9277-0","10.1109/DSR.2011.6026821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026821","divers;ventilation function;signal processing","Lungs;Indexes;Acoustics;Noise;Humans;Ventilation","","1","","9","IEEE","22 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Systems for automatic essay assessment have been commercially available since 1990's. However, the progress in the field was obstructed by a lack of qualitative information regarding the effectiveness of such systems. Most of the research in automatic essay grading has been associated with English writing due to its widespread use and the availability of more learner collection and language processing software for the language. In addition, there is large number of commercial software for grading programming assignments automatically. In this work, we investigate document semantic similarity based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use an open-source Python software, Gensim, to develop and implement an essay grading system able to compare an essay to an answer-key and assign to it a grade based on semantic similarity between the two. We test our tool on variable-size essays and conduct experimental tests to compare the results obtained from human grader (professor) and those obtained from the automatic grading system. Results show high correlation between the professor grades and the grades assigned by both modeling techniques. However, LSA-based modeling showed more promising results than the LDA-based method.","","978-0-7381-1180-3","10.1109/SNAMS52053.2020.9336533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9336533","Machine Learning;Latent Semantic Analysis;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Semantic Similarity","Social networking (online);Semantics;Tools;Writing;Resource management;Security;Python","","12","","43","IEEE","3 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the use of SM is motivated by its low-complexity implementation in comparison to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, achieved through the activation of a single antenna during transmission. Moreover, energy detection-based communications restrict the channel state information to the magnitude of the fading gains. This consideration makes the design applicable for low-cost low-powered devices since phase estimation and its associated circuitry are avoided. We derive an energy detection metric for a multi-antenna receiver based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion. By considering a biased pulse amplitude modulation, we develop an analytical framework for the SM symbol error rate at high signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical results show that the diversity order is proportional to half the number of receive antennas; this result stems from having partial receiver channel knowledge. In addition, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with that of the coherent ML receiver and show that the SM energy detector outperforms its coherent counterpart in certain scenarios, particularly when utilizing non-negative constellations. Ultimately, we implement an SM testbed using software-defined radio devices and provide experimental error rate measurements that validate our theoretical contribution.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2023.3314870","European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:819819); European Regional Development Fund and the Republic of Cyprus through the Research and Innovation Foundation(grant numbers:CONCEPT/0722/0123 (FLOAT)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10250901","Spatial modulation;energy detection;biased pulse-amplitude modulation;diversity;software-defined radio;experimental results","Symbols;Modulation;Receiving antennas;Detectors;Transmitting antennas;Error analysis;Complexity theory","","","","39","IEEE","13 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a novel technique, In-Vivo Clone Detection, that detects functional clones in arbitrary programs by identifying and mining their inputs and outputs. The key insight is to use existing workloads to execute programs and then measure functional similarities between programs based on their inputs and outputs, which mitigates the problems in object oriented languages reported by prior work.

The disadvantages of the above strategy can be avoided by reducing the structure of aircraft components to a finite element model and quickly checking the key components in the health management system. In order to solve the problem of fast calculation of the finite element model of the key components of the aircraft, a parallel algorithm and framework of large-scale sparse matrix preprocessing conjugate gradient method based on CUDA(Compute Unified Device Architecture) technology is proposed in the multi GPU(Graphics Processing Unit) workstation cluster environment. Once the sparse matrix is too large to be processed in a single workstation, this paper discusses how to realize the optimized data segmentation in the distributed multi-GPU computing environment. For the problem of iterative solution of matrix preprocessing, two preprocessing strategies of matrix bandwidth reduction parallelization and incomplete Cholesky decomposition are proposed, and asynchronous task concurrency and load balancing strategies are designed on the architecture.

This technique implements different levels of diversity (architectural and temporal) by using two different architectures of converters (a ΣA converter and two successive approximation register (SAR) converters) operating with distinct sampling rates. The experiment was performed in a vacuum chamber, using a 16O ion beam with 36-MeV energy and sufficient penetration into the silicon to produce an effective linear energy transfer (LET) of 5.5 MeV/mg/cm2 at the active region. The average flux was approximately 350 particles/s/cm2 for 246 min. The individual susceptibility of each converter to single-event effects is evaluated, as well as the whole system cross section.

Many classical detectors are proposed based on the linear mixing model and the sparsity model. However, the former type of model cannot deal well with spectral variability in limited endmembers, and the latter type of model usually treats the target detection as a simple classification problem and pays less attention to the low target probability. In this case, can we find an efficient way to utilize both the high-dimension features behind hyperspectral images and the limited target information to extract small targets? This paper proposes a novel sparsity-based detector named the hybrid sparsity and statistics detector (HSSD) for target detection in hyperspectral imagery, which can effectively deal with the above two problems. The proposed algorithm designs a hypothesis-specific dictionary based on the prior hypotheses for the test pixel, which can avoid the imbalanced number of training samples for a class-specific dictionary. Then, a purification process is employed for the background training samples in order to construct an effective competition between the two hypotheses. Next, a sparse representation-based binary hypothesis model merged with additive Gaussian noise is proposed to represent the image. Finally, a generalized likelihood ratio test is performed to obtain a more robust detection decision than the reconstruction residual-based detection methods. Extensive experimental results with three hyperspectral data sets confirm that the proposed HSSD algorithm clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art target detectors.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2601268","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61471274,41431175,U1536204,60473023,61302111); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP-140102164,FT-130101457,LE140100061); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2014CFB193); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547286","Hyperspectral imagery;sparse representation;statistical characteristic;target detection","Hyperspectral imaging;Object detection;Detectors;Training;Face;Dictionaries","","165","","42","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To realize the spatial pooler's operation in hardware, we propose a new spatial-pooling memristor crossbar that converts the inputs from sensory organ into the sparse distributed representation (SDR) of cortical neurons, in this paper. The spatial pooling is composed of overlapping, inhibition, and learning steps. The proposed memristor crossbar can perform exactly the same functions of overlapping, inhibition, and learning with the spatial-pooling software algorithm. By converting the sensory information to SDR using the spatial-pooling memristor crossbar, we can have the following advantages for the cortical information processing: first, preserving the semantic similarity through the spatial pooling; second, changing synaptic weights continuously; third, keeping the sparsity of SDR as low as 2% like brain's neocortex; and fourth, improving the noise robustness. In this paper, these four properties of the spatial pooling in brain's neocortex have been simulated and verified in the memristor crossbar circuit. For verifying the spatial-pooling operation, the memristor crossbar has been tested for MNIST image recognition in this paper.

Numerous methods and algorithms are proposed to address the task of semantic textual similarity which is one of the sub-branches of text processing. Due to the special features of the Persian language and its non-standard writing system, finding semantic similarity is an even more challenging task in Persian. On the other hand, producing a proper corpus that can be used for training a model for finding semantic similarities, is of great importance. In this study, the main purpose is to propose a method for measuring the semantic similarity between short Persian texts. To do so, first, we try to build an appropriate corpus, and then propose an efficient approach based on neural networks. The proposed method involves three steps. The first step is data collection and building a parallel corpus. In the next step, namely the pre-processing step, the data is normalized. Finally, Semantic similarity recognition is done by the neural network using vector representations of the words. The suggested model is built upon the produced corpus made of movie and tv show subtitles containing 35266 sentence pairs. The F-measure of the proposed approach on PAN2016 is 75.98% with 4 tags and 98.87% with 2 tags.

Employing attention mechanisms to extract part features has become a trend. However, there are two major limitations in these methods: First, they often focus on the most salient part while neglecting other inconspicuous but distinguishable parts. Second, they treat different part features in isolation while neglecting their relationships. To handle these limitations, we propose to locate multiple different distinguishable parts and explore their relationships in an explicit way. In this pursuit, we introduce two lightweight modules that can be easily plugged into existing convolutional neural networks. On one hand, we introduce a feature boosting and suppression module that boosts the most salient part of feature maps to obtain a part-specific representation and suppresses it to force the following network to mine other potential parts. On the other hand, we introduce a feature diversification module that learns semantically complementary information from the correlated part-specific representations. Our method does not need bounding boxes/part annotations and can be trained end-to-end. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on several benchmark fine-grained datasets.

In this work, we tackled the decision-making process related to diversion scenarios. Diversion is a deviation or alternative from the original flight plan, usually due to some problem caused in the aircraft, such as leakage of fuel, of engine and in aerodynamic surfaces, among other problems of the aircraft that can make it impossible to arrive at the previously defined destination airport. We propose a case-based reasoning (CBR) model for aiding the pilot to deal with diversion situations, chosen as adequate scenarios from the results of a survey conducted with pilots to identify those for which an AI-based approach might be helpful regarding decision making. A CBR system basically uses a memory of recorded cases for generating new solutions to similar problems, it thus contains a ""memory"" of cases with descriptions of specific situations that occurred in the past, solutions of these described situations, and the evaluation of their results. The reasoner solves new problems by adapting in-memory solutions to it, via some similarity criteria. Specific similarity measures for comparing cases and retrieving the ones most similar to the diversion situation at hand were defined, and a database for 26 diversion cases was built for conducting the experiments on decision making. Case retrieval experiments over 20 diversion test situations produced a success rate (that is, a diversion suggestion compatible with pilot decisions) of 85%. We intend to perform as future work an extension of the cases database by incorporating real diversion situations, dynamic attributes related to weather and traffic intensity at the diversion airport, and a more comprehensive assessment by pilots, possibly towards a learnable automatic weight adjustment for the attributes that compose the case similarity metric.","2155-7209","979-8-3503-3357-2","10.1109/DASC58513.2023.10311203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10311203","Decision-Making;Diversion;Artificial Intelligence;Case-Based Reasoning","Surveys;Databases;Atmospheric modeling;Decision making;Airports;Aerodynamics;Cognition","","","","13","IEEE","10 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, the diversification mechanism is mostly realized by perturbing the incumbent solutions to escape from local optima. In this paper, we report our attempt toward providing a new diversification mechanism, which is based on the concept of instance perturbation. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed mechanism achieves the diversification by perturbing the instance under solving, rather than the solutions. To tackle the challenge of incorporating instance perturbation into hyper-heuristics, we also design a new hyper-heuristic framework HIP-HOP (recursive acronym of HIP-HOP is an instance perturbation-based hyper-heuristic optimization procedure), which employs a grammar guided high level strategy to manipulate the low level heuristics. With the expressive power of the grammar, the constraints, such as the feasibility of the output solution could be easily satisfied. Numerical results and statistical tests over both the Ising spin glass problem and the p-median problem instances show that HIP-HOP is able to achieve promising performances. Furthermore, runtime distribution analysis reveals that, although being relatively slow at the beginning, HIP-HOP is able to achieve competitive solutions once given sufficient time.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2294185","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT13RC(3)53); New Century Excellent Talents in University(grant numbers:NCET-13-0073); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61370144,61175062,61300017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690192","Hyper-heuristics;instance perturbation;Ising spin glass;linear genetic programming;p-median;Hyper-heuristics;instance perturbation;Ising spin glass;linear genetic programming;$p$ -median","Glass;Linear programming;Search problems;Vectors;Grammar;Problem-solving;Genetic programming","","12","","54","IEEE","20 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, various adaptive and intelligent traffic light control approaches have been adopted in many cities, resulting in the development of current GLOSA technologies lagging behind that of traffic light technologies. When taking diverse dynamic traffic lights into account, it is difficult to model the interactions between vehicles and traffic lights, which is further exacerbated by the hybrid control strategies of traffic lights. To this end, we design a new GLOSA system SpeedAdv to provide optimal speed advisory for addressing diverse traffic lights. We formulate the problem as a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MAMDP) with an implicit common goal and propose a heterogeneous-agent collaborative framework based on reinforcement learning. Three main modules are used in the system: i) a spatio-temporal relation reasoning module based on the phase-aware attention mechanism pays more attention to the traffic rules and traffic flow diversion of adjacent intersections to predict traffic conditions for a few seconds later; ii) a behavior approximating module based on imitation learning is introduced to approximate the phases of diverse traffic lights; iii) a speed advisory module provides the optimal speed advisory based on policy gradient reinforcement learning relying on the above two modules and other information collected by vehicles. We implement and evaluate SpeedAdv with a real-world trajectory dataset, together with a field test based on a prototype system, demonstrating that SpeedAdv improves the overall performance by at least 24.1% in terms of travel time, energy consumption, safety, and comfort compared to the state-of-the-art GreenDrive method.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2023.3319697","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62222202,62232004,61972044); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921003); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B18008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265152","Cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system;GLOSA;deep reinforcement learning;heterogeneous agents","Reinforcement learning;Green products;Vehicle dynamics;Uncertainty;Safety;Urban areas;Trajectory","","1","","61","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its uniqueness ensures that the sensor pattern noises extracted from different cameras are strongly uncorrelated, even when they belong to the same camera model. However, with the advent of computational photography, most recent devices heavily process the acquired pixels, possibly introducing non-unique artifacts that may reduce PRNU noise's distinctiveness, especially when several exemplars of the same device model are involved in the analysis. Considering that PRNU is an image forensic technology that finds actual and wide use by law enforcement agencies worldwide, it is essential to keep validating such technology on recent devices as they appear. In this paper, we perform an extensive testing campaign on over 33.000 Flickr images belonging to 45 smartphone and 25 DSLR camera models released recently to determine how widespread the issue is and which is the plausible cause. Experiments highlight that most brands, like Samsung, Huawei, Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, Sigma, and Leica, are strongly affected by this issue. We show that the primary cause of high false alarm rates cannot be directly related to specific camera models, firmware, nor image contents. It is evident that the effectiveness of PRNU based source identification on the most recent devices must be reconsidered in light of these results. Therefore, this paper is intended as a call to action for the scientific community rather than a complete treatment of the subject. Moreover, we believe publishing these data is important to raise awareness about a possible issue with PRNU reliability in the law enforcement world.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070478","Air Force Research Laboratory through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:HR00112090136); Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)(grant numbers:2017Z595XS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9393356","Image processing;image classification;image forensics;source identification","Cameras;Software;Image resolution;Law enforcement;Task analysis;Pipelines;Multimedia Web sites","","23","","34","CCBY","1 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

PDMS implements parallelism through sub-division of networks based on their natural features. Each sub-network is run in parallel on separate processor cores using a single thread processing, and with such setup it outperforms the multi-threaded BLAS by the factor of 20. With multi-threading implemented, the performance dreadfully goes down, and processing time increases.

The parameter, sequence similarity, which is calculated from the two recorded handover sequences of the two parallel roads in every simulation test, is used to evaluate the extent which the two parallel roads have the same continuous handover. The results of two hundreds of simulation tests show that the same continuous handover sequence probability is higher in the suburban simulation experiment scene than in urban one possibly because the larger cell radius in suburban areas covers more roads.

To detect spam reviews, the paper presents a set of opinion spam detection's identification indicators based on behavior features of the spammer. Two algorithms are then proposed to recognize similar reviews and relevant reviews from all reviews. Compared to the traditional algorithm, our review identification algorithm achieves shorter execution time. More importantly, the proposed algorithm for recognizing relevant reviews can be used to analyze the relevancy between the review content and the given review topic by using the automatic word segmentation technique. The Experimental results show that the number of fake reviews by our algorithms is higher than that of the traditional algorithm.

Our strategy is to allocate directory state only on a miss from a node in a different affinity domain from the directory. We call this ALLocAte on Remote Miss, or ALLARM. Our solution is entirely backward compatible with existing operating systems and software, and provides a means to scale cache coherence into the many-core era. On a mix of SPLASH2 and Parsec workloads, ALLARM is able to improve performance by 13% on average while reducing dynamic energy consumption by 9% in the on-chip network and 15% in the directory controller.

Current methods are able to reconstruct surfaces by learning Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) from single point clouds without ground truth signed distances or point normals. However, they require the point clouds to be dense, which dramatically limits their performance in real applications. To resolve this issue, we propose to reconstruct highly accurate surfaces from sparse point clouds with an on-surface prior. We train a neural network to learn SDFs via projecting queries onto the surface represented by the sparse point cloud. Our key idea is to infer signed distances by pushing both the query projections to be on the surface and the projection distance to be the minimum. To achieve this, we train a neural network to capture the on-surface prior to determine whether a point is on a sparse point cloud or not, and then leverage it as a differentiable function to learn SDFs from unseen sparse point cloud. Our method can learn SDFs from a single s parse point cloud without ground truth signed distances or point normals. Our numerical evaluation under widely used benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, especially for sparse point clouds.

Individual samples are typically a mixture of only one, two, three, or occasionally four minerals. Therefore, in order to avoid overfitting, a sparse unmixing algorithm is required. We compare three such algorithms using some real world test data sets: full subset selection (FSS), sparse demixing (SD), and L1 regularization. To aid the comparison, we introduce two novel aspects: 1) the simultaneous fitting of the low frequency background with mineral identification (which provides greater model flexibility) and 2) the combined fitting being carried out using a suitably defined Mahalanobis distance; this has certain optimality properties under an idealized model. Together, these two innovations significantly improve the accuracy of the results. FSS and L1 regularization (suitably optimized) produce similar levels of accuracy, and are superior to SD.

This motivates us to propose a novel Two-stream Prototype Learning Network (TSPLN) for FSFR under occlusions by simultaneously considering the quality of support images and their relevance to the query image. Specifically, we design a two-stream architecture, which mainly consists of a support-centered stream and query-centered stream, to learn the optimal class prototypes. The former stream is to reduce the negative impact of occluded images on the prototype. This is achieved by exploring the similarities between different images in the support set. In the query-centered stream, we exploit the relevance between the query and support set based on feature alignment (FA).

In a visible-light communication (VLC) system, the transmission nature can be of two types: (1) all LEDs transmit the same signal stream simultaneously; or (2) each LED transmits different parts of a signal stream independently. The MIMO-diversity technique detects and computes the transmitted signal power during reception and conditionally informs the transmitter to switch between Type (1) and Type (2) transmission. Two experimental models have been tested to show the feasibility of such a technique. In the first model, we constructed a full transceiver and uses a switch IC to switch between MIMO and diversity. The second model uses a microcontroller and software decision to switch between two COM ports, each of them dedicated to MIMO and diversity output respectively. Results suggest that shadowing and alignment problems commonly encountered in visible-light communication systems can be readily solved using these methods. A focusing equation has also been formulated to predict signal intensity more accurately. The focusing gap between the concentrator and the photodiode is taken into consideration during channel computation.","1530-1346","978-1-4799-3755-4","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755008","","MIMO;Optical switches;Light emitting diodes;Switching circuits;Photodiodes;Receivers","","","","8","IEEE","6 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the feature extraction step, a set of local binary pattern-based features is computed from both the signature image and its under-sampled bitmap. Interval-valued symbolic data is then created for each feature in every signature class. As a result, a signature model composed of a set of interval values (corresponding to the number of features) is obtained for each individual's handwritten signature class. A novel fuzzy similarity measure is further proposed to compute the similarity between a test sample signature and the corresponding interval-valued symbolic model for the verification of the test sample. To evaluate the proposed verification approach, a benchmark offline English signature data set (GPDS-300) and a large data set (BHSig260) composed of Bangla and Hindi offline signatures were used. A comparison of our results with some recent signature verification methods available in the literature was provided in terms of average error rate and we noted that the proposed method always outperforms when the number of training samples is eight or more.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2707332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932929","Off-line signature verification;interval-valued symbolic representation;fuzzy similarity measure;texture feature extraction","Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Forgery;Computational modeling;Training;Biometrics (access control)","","49","","56","IEEE","23 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Automatic Generation of Plagiarism Detection Among Student Programs","R. E. Roxas; N. R. Lim; N.

Existing plagiarism detectors are either applied to a programming language or a pre-defined set of programming languages. The general purpose one usually employs string matching to perform similarity measures that are based on plagiarism detection among documents in general, and not in programs in particular, thus, losing much of the structure and logic of programs in the process. On the other hand, plagiarism detectors for specific languages only cater to that particular set of languages. This study provides a means for the user to specify the programming language of the student programs to be analyzed. Moreover, an automatic plagiarism detector system must be immune to the transformations that students perform on copied programs. These transformations are usually dependent on several factors namely: the type of programming problems and correspondingly, the complexity of the project to be implemented by the students, and also the programming language paradigm of the programs. Thus, the similarity measures employed by the system should be determined by these factors and can be specified by the professor. He/she has the option to specify how the similarities among the student programs will be captured. The system provides an interface for the specification of the particular programming language in which the student programs are implemented, and a knowledgebase of similarity measures that the user would like to include in the analysis of the student programs. Hence, the system provides flexibility in the programming language of the student programs to be analyzed and the similarity measures that the professor wishes to employ. Initial qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate a flexible, convenient and cost-effective tool for building plagiarism detectors for effective detection of programs in various imperative and procedural programming languages. The approach also addresses some of the changes that students perform on copied programs which JPlag fails to handle, thus, allowing for improved accuracy in terms of the reduction of false-positives, increasing the chance of catching plagiarized programs. These changes include modification of control structures, use of temporary variables and subexpressions, in-lining and re-factoring of methods, and redundancy (variables or methods that were not used). Comprehensive tests on other programming languages under various programming language paradigms such as object-oriented, logic and functional languages, considering the different changes that the students employ to copied programs (such as the tests done in JPlag) are also recommended for empirical evaluation","","1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141631","Plagiarism detection;transformations;similarity measures","Plagiarism;Computer languages;Detectors;Computer science;Logic testing;Particle measurements;Logic programming;Performance evaluation;Area measurement;Education","","3","","16","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their penetration in our daily life increases the need for their enhanced resilience and for means to secure and protect them. One major threat is the software monoculture. Latest research work illustrated the danger of software monoculture and introduced diversity to reduce the attack surface. In this paper, we propose a biologically-inspired defense system, ChameleonSoft, that employs multidimensional software diversity to, in effect, induce spatiotemporal software behavior encryption and a moving target defense. The key principles are decoupling functional roles and runtime role players; devising intrinsically-resilient composable online programmable building blocks; separating logic, state and physical resources; and employing functionally-equivalent, behaviorally-different code variants. Given, our construction, ChameleonSoft is also equipped with an autonomic failure recovery mechanism for enhanced resilience. Nodes employing ChameleonSoft autonomously and cooperatively change their recovery and encryption policy both proactively and reactively according to the continual change in context and environment. In order to test the applicability of the proposed approach, we present a prototype of the ChameleonSoft Behavior Encryption (CBE) and recovery mechanisms. Further, using analysis and simulation, we study the performance and security aspects of the proposed system. This study aims to evaluate the provisioned level of security by measuring the level of induced confusion and diffusion to quantify the strength of the CBE mechanism. Further, we compute the computational cost of security provisioning and enhancing system resilience. A brief attack scenario is also included to illustrate the complexity of attacking ChameleonSoft.","","978-1-936968-36-7","10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2011.247115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144809","Cyber security;Ubiquitous computing;Software diversity;Online programmability;Biologically-inspired security","Runtime;Monitoring;Software;Virtual machining;Organisms","","12","2","24","","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hierarchical clustering algorithms are deterministic, stable, and do not need a pre-determined number of clusters as input. However, they are not scalable for very large data due to their non-linear complexity. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to reduce the complexity of Hierarchical Clustering, improve the purity of the clustering algorithm, and reduce the chaining factor. The proposed method has the following components: (i) A new combination similarity based on common-neighbours of graph theory is proposed, (ii) In every iteration, instead of calculating the centroids for new clusters, new centroids are estimated from centroids in previous iteration, and (iii) In each iteration, instead of merging only one pair of objects, multiple pairs are merged at the same time. In addition to the proposed combination similarity, four well-known methods including centroid-based, group-based, complete-link, and single-link, have been also implemented. All five methods are tested and evaluated using two metrics: purity and imbalance or chaining factor. We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other classic methods.","","978-1-5090-4470-2","10.1109/WI.2016.0093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817110","Hierarchical clustering;common neighbors;text clustering","Clustering algorithms;Merging;Complexity theory;Graph theory;Measurement;Estimation;Computers","","3","","14","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to its inherent ill-posed nature, seismic deconvolution poses significant challenges. The conventional approach for deconvolution employs a sparse inversion strategy to reconstruct underground reflection coefficients but overlooks the spatial relationship between adjacent seismic traces, resulting in inadequate spatial continuity of the deconvolved results. In this letter, we propose an adaptive seismic deconvolution strategy that incorporates spatial continuity regularization based on local seismic similarity. The adaptive multitrace deconvolution process consists of three parts: first, we consider spatial continuity by introducing a spatial regularization term derived from local seismic similarity; second, we formulate an objective function by combining  $L1$ -2 norm for sparse regularization with terms accounting for misfit and spatial regularization to reconstruct reflectivity; finally, we solve the objective function using alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) and L-BFGS algorithms. Our proposed method effectively preserves weak effective signals while providing a clearer depiction of geological body distribution and ensuring superior spatial continuity in complex geological structures. Synthetic and field data tests demonstrate that our proposed method yields high-resolution deconvolved results with strong spatial continuity.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3413686","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42304120); Research and Development Department of CNPC(grant numbers:2022DQ0604-03); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M733870); China University of Petroleum (Beijing) Research Foundation(grant numbers:2462023SZBH002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556726","Seismic data;seismic deconvolution;sparse reconstruction;spatial continuity","Deconvolution;Reflectivity;Linear programming;Reflection coefficient;Spatial resolution;Geology;Reflection","","","","21","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
