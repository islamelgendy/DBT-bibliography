"An Adaptive User-Genre-Item Model for Collaborative Filtering","J. -M. Yang; K. F.

In collaborative filtering, memory-based approaches make predictions by measuring the whole similarity between two users. When a user has multiple interest genres, those methods seem too optimistic in making correct predictions in some situations. In addition, minor genres are often inhibited due to their minute share of the whole similarity. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines the advantages of item-item similarity and user-user similarity by introducing a genre component to the relation between user and item. In our approach, the direct user-item relevance is developed into the combination of genre similarity and preference similarity, thus capturing more accurately the relevance between items as well as between user and item. Experimental results from EachMovie and MovieLens datasets show that our approach outperforms four other state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms.","2154-5952","978-1-4244-1189-4","10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4313224","Collaborative filtering;genre similarity;preference similarity;relevance measurement","Collaboration;Adaptive filters;Testing;Sparse matrices;Filtering algorithms;Recommender systems;Information filtering;Information filters;Databases;Collaborative software","","2","","19","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper focuses on finding cross-language dependencies in such diverse, heterogeneous software systems. Our approach uses source navigator extractors to produce the facts inside each language. Then, we show an example for finding Java Native Interface (JNI) dependencies between facts from Java and C/C++ code. The integrated facts are produced in GXL form, and conform to a unified schema introduced in the paper. This approach is useful from several perspectives. It illustrates how to retrieve the dependencies from software systems written in more than one programming language. Also, the generated facts conform to the GXL format, which is accepted by many reverse engineering tools.

Various kinds of research have been conducted on similarity retrievals of 3D models since the late 1990's. Although most of the retrieval techniques focus on shape similarity of the 3D models, our technique allows users to retrieve and classify 3D models based on texture pattern similarity. To test our texture similarity retrieval technique, a set of a textured 3D model database was synthesized from 3D polygonal models and 2D texture images. The database was analyzed by software programs, and texture features were extracted from each 3D model. The extracted texture features were computed based on HLAC (higher order local autocorrelation) and fractal dimensions. Often, both kinds of texture features were used for analyzing 2D texture images. However, we extended the techniques to handle three dimensional volumetric data for extracting features from textured 3D models. Our experimental web-based retrieval system successfully retrieved textured 3D models with fairly acceptable recall-precision rates. This retrieval technique which is based on texture patterns can be used in conjunction with traditional shape similarity retrieval techniques, and the technique can enhance similarity retrieval performances.","","978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466933","Solid texture;Similarity Retrieval;Shape feature;3D Model;Multimedia database","Feature extraction;Data mining;Shape;Image databases;Spatial databases;Image texture analysis;Testing;Information retrieval;Image retrieval;Data analysis","","2","1","18","IEEE","20 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of design diversity depends on the assumption that functionally equivalent services, i.e., variant services, rarely fail on the same input case. However, there are no directives to assess whether variant services are actually diverse and fail on disjoint subsets of the input space. Aim: To provide proper assessment of service diversity in order to achieve a high level of reliability by employing either a diversity-based solution with the variant services or a single service that exhibits higher reliability than would be the case if design diversity was adopted. Method: We propose an experimental setup that encompasses (i) a set of directives to organize the preparation and execution of the experiment to investigate service diversity; (ii) investigation of whether variant services are actually diverse by using statistical tests; and (iii) an analysis of if and by how much the reliability of a diversity-based solution that leverages voters is an improvement over one that uses a single service. We evaluated the applicability and usefulness of the proposed experimental setup by employing it to assess diversity of variant services adhering to four different requirements specifications. For each specification, we analysed three different services. Results: We found that the proposed directives were effective for the purposes of this assessment. Assessment results demonstrated that services implementing the four requirements specifications are actually diverse at a 0.05 significance level. For two of the specifications, coincident failures of two or more services are infrequent enough to promote gains in overall system reliability.

Face recognition application in computer system have been developed in recent year including surveillance, human-computer interaction, and multimedia application. Some challenges will possibly be undergone in face recognition research mostly lie on deformation of face condition such as pose, expression, illumination, and accessories use that lead to a noticeable impact on recognition rate. In this research, two-dimensional Gabor wavelet filter bank was implemented to extract face image. Gabor filter has characteristic similar to wavelet that is localized in both time and frequency domain able to extract local feature on face image. Convolution process produces a face representation feature called Gaborface in a terms of magnitude information obtained from sinusoidal complex function. Features are formed as a column matrix concatenation which is called feature vector. At the end of process, one distance-based similarity measure, i.e., Euclidean Distance was implemented to perform a test measurement on data features vector with database features. Testing has been done by giving variation in some aspects, i.e., number of training data, face image deformation such pose and expression, and the variant of filter with variation in scale and orientation. The best system, based on this research, is achieved by $5 \times 8$ filter bank with accuracy up to 98,67%. The proposed method also shows a very well performance in recognizing the expression changes, but it cannot accommodate properly in pose changes.","","979-8-3503-4571-1","10.1109/ICIC56845.2022.10007016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10007016","Face Recognition;Computer Vision;2-D Gabor Wavelet Filter Bank;distance-based similarity measure;Euclidean Distance","Wavelet domain;Face recognition;Filter banks;Training data;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Gabor filters","","1","","15","IEEE","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then it is showed that the precision of algorithms that only take into account the functional properties of services for measuring their similarity are low. Therefore the textual descriptions of Web services are also taken into account and the textual similarity of services is also calculated.

In this paper, we propose a Transfer Sparse Coding (TSC) approach to construct robust sparse representations for classifying cross-distribution images accurately. Specifically, we aim to minimize the distribution divergence between the labeled and unlabeled images, and incorporate this criterion into the objective function of sparse coding to make the new representations robust to the distribution difference.

We first analyze the tracking performance of standard online linear classifiers, which use gradient descent for minimizing the regularized hinge loss. The derived shifting bounds highlight the importance of choosing appropriate step sizes in the presence of concept drifts. Notably, we show that a better adaptability to concept drifts can be achieved using constant step sizes rather than the state-of-the-art decreasing step sizes. Based on these observations, we then propose a novel sparse approximated linear classifier, called sparse approximated linear classification (SALC), which uses a constant step size. In essence, SALC simply rounds small weights to zero for achieving sparsity and controls the truncation error in a principled way for achieving a low tracking regret. The degree of sparsity obtained by SALC is continuous and can be controlled by a parameter which captures the tradeoff between the sparsity of the model and the regret performance of the algorithm. Experiments on nine stationary data sets show that SALC is superior to the state-of-the-art sparse online learning algorithms, especially when the solution is required to be sparse; on seven groups of nonstationary data sets with various total shifting amounts, SALC also presents a good ability to track drifts. When wrapped with a drift detector, SALC achieves a remarkable tracking performance regardless of the total shifting amount.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2877433","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB0702600,2017YFB0702601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61432008,61503178,U1435214); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20150587); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8533616","Concept drift;curse of dimensionality;online linear classification;shifting regret;sparse online learning","Prediction algorithms;Measurement;Task analysis;Standards;Predictive models;Data models;Heuristic algorithms","","9","","35","IEEE","13 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, these tests are conducted with boards placed horizontally. However, real-world service environments involve impacts at various angles that can lead to different failure mechanisms in solder joints. In this study, we investigate the impact reliability of microbump interconnect structures under different impact angles. By considering plastic strain analysis, we demonstrate that drop impacts at other angles can be equivalently represented by the scenario with drop angle  $\alpha =$  0° impact. Subsequently, we analyze the failure mechanism of microbumps during drop tests and propose a predictive model for their drop life under varying impact angles. Our results indicate that as the drop angle increases, there is a transition in the driving force for microbump failures from tensile and compressive stress to shear stress.

To solve these problems, in this paper, we present a new approach to malware similarity analysis based on the network control structure graph (NCSG). This method analyzed the behavior of malware by application program interface (API) association and constructed NCSG. The graph could reflect the command-and-control(C&C) logic of malware. Therefore, it can resist the interference of code obfuscation technology. The structural features extracted from NCSG will be used as the basis of similarity analysis for training the detection model. Finally, we tested the dataset constructed from five known malware family samples, and the experimental results showed that the accuracy of this method for malware variation analysis reached 92.75%.

Existing works usually assume that the query function and target function share equal semantics and compare their full semantics to obtain the similarity. However, we find that the function mapping is more complex, especially when function inlining happens. In this paper, we will systematically investigate cross-inlining binary function similarity detection. We first construct a cross-inlining dataset by compiling 51 projects using 9 compilers, with 4 optimizations, to 6 architectures, with 2 inlining flags, which results in two datasets both with 216 combinations. Then we construct the cross-inlining function mappings by linking the common source functions in these two datasets. Through analysis of this dataset, we find that three cross-inlining patterns widely exist while existing work suffers when detecting cross-inlining binary function simi-larity. Next, we propose a pattern-based model named CI-Detector for cross-inlining matching. CI-Detector uses the attributed CFG to represent the semantics of binary functions and GNN to embed bi-nary functions into vectors. CI-Detector respectively trains a model for these three cross-inlining patterns. Finally, the testing pairs are input to these three models and all the produced similarities are aggregated to produce the final similarity. We conduct several experiments to evaluate CI-Detector. Results show that CI-Detector can detect cross-inlining pairs with a precision of 81% and a recall of 97%, which exceeds all state-of-the-art works.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10549732","Cross-Inlining;Binary Similarity Detection;Inlining Pattern","Semantics;Vectors;Security;Pattern matching;Optimization;Testing;Software engineering","","","","84","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the intrinsic and lightweight nature of a PUF, they have been proposed to provide security at a low cost for many applications, in particular for the internet of things (IoT). Many metrics have been proposed to evaluate the security and performance of PUF architectures, two of which are uniqueness and min-entropy. The uniqueness of a PUF response evaluates its ability to differentiate between different physical devices, while the min-entropy estimation is a measure of how much uncertainty the PUF response contains. The min-entropy is a lower-bound of real entropy. When the uniqueness of a PUF design is close to the optimal, it is unclear if this also implies that the design has a significantly high entropy; hence it would be useful to ascertain the minimum uniqueness required to achieve a given entropy. To date, a thorough investigation of the relationship between uniqueness and entropy for PUF designs has not been conducted. In this paper, this relationship between the uniqueness and entropy is explored, and for the first time, to the authors' knowledge, the relationship between them is modeled. To verify this model, both simulated and hardware-based experimental results are performed, with a test-bed containing 184 Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA based Basys3 boards providing a large data set for granular results. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model accurately estimates the relationship between uniqueness and min-entropy, with both the theoretical analysis and software simulations closely matching the experimental results.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2018.2866241","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion(grant numbers:2016-0-00399); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/N508664/-CSIT2); EU 7th Framework Programme(grant numbers:608224,FP7/2007-2013); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771239); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20151477); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8444682","Entropy;physical unclonable functions;uniqueness","Entropy;Security;Internet of Things;Analytical models;Software;Performance evaluation","","15","","22","CCBY","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, its classification performance would be heavily deteriorated if the number k of nearest neighbors was unsuitably fixed for each testing sample. This study examines the feasibility of using only one fixed k value for FKNN on each testing sample. A novel FKNN-based classification method, namely, fuzzy KNN method with adaptive nearest neighbors (A-FKNN), is devised for learning a distinct optimal k value for each testing sample. In the training stage, after applying a sparse representation method on all training samples for reconstruction, A-FKNN learns the optimal  ${k}$  value for each training sample and builds a decision tree (namely, A-FKNN tree) from all training samples with new labels (the learned optimal  ${k}$  values instead of the original labels), in which each leaf node stores the corresponding optimal  ${k}$  value. In the testing stage, A-FKNN identifies the optimal  ${k}$  value for each testing sample by searching the A-FKNN tree and runs FKNN with the optimal  ${k}$  value for each testing sample. Moreover, a fast version of A-FKNN, namely, FA-FKNN, is designed by building the FA-FKNN decision tree, which stores the optimal k value with only a subset of training samples in each leaf node. Experimental results on 32 UCI datasets demonstrate that both A-FKNN and FA-FKNN outperform the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy, and FA-FKNN has a shorter running time.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.3031610","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772198,61972181); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20191331); National First-Class Discipline Program of Light Industry and Engineering(grant numbers:LITE2018); University of Macao Talent Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9269360","Decision tree;fuzzy k-nearest-neighbor method (FKNN);nearest neighbors;sparse representation/reconstruction","Testing;Training;Decision trees;Uncertainty;Standards;Reconstruction algorithms;Media","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis","23","","56","IEEE","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent proliferation of IoT devices has also increased the demand for similarity detection across different architectures. However, there are currently not many examples of feature extraction methods using neural machine translation (NMT) models being applied to similarity detection in basic block units across different architectures. In this research, we propose new methods that extract features at a higher speed and detect similarities across different architectures with higher accuracy than existing methods for basic block feature extraction using neural machine translation models. We assume that the intermediate representation of the NMT model, which learned the translation of basic blocks across different architectures, includes the semantics of the instructions in the basic block. Hence we adopted the intermediate representation as the features of the basic blocks. Then, we applied the linear transformation used in bilingual word embedding to match the embedding space of basic blocks across different architectures. This enables the similarity detection in basic block units across different architectures with higher accuracy than the distance learning method used in existing research to match the embedding space. In the evaluation experiment, we compare the Precision at k (P@k) on the same dataset with existing research methods and our method achieved the highest accuracy of 92%. In addition, We also compare the time required for feature extraction using GPUs, and found that it was up to 16 times faster.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3316215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254199","Binary code similarity detection;machine learning;neural machine translation","Feature extraction;Binary codes;Semantics;Software engineering;Computer architecture;Training;Source coding;Machine learning;Neural networks;Machine translation","","","","38","CCBYNCND","18 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The computations are divided into offline and online computations to maximize performance and fast response algorithms.","","978-1-7281-5506-7","10.1109/SmartCloud.2019.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091406","personalized recommendation;Collaborative filtering;user similarity model;user feature vector;real-time recommendation algorithms","Collaboration;Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Data models;Software engineering;Computational modeling;Feature extraction","","1","","12","IEEE","14 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A unified method based on CIUSes is developed for automatically generating executable test cases for both control flow and data flow aspects of an EFSM. In control flow testing, CIUSes are very useful in confirming the tail state of the transitions. In data flow testing, CIUSes improve the observability of the test cases for the def-use associations of different variables used in the EFSM.

Since the time that inspections were developed they have been shown to be powerful defect detection strategies. However, little research has been done to investigate their application to OO systems, which have very different structural and execution models compared to procedural systems. This suggests that inspection techniques may not be currently being deployed to their best effect in the context of large-scale OO systems. Work to date has revealed three significant issues that need to be addressed - the identification of chunks of code to be inspected, the order in which the code is read, and the resolution of frequent nonlocal references. Three techniques are developed with the aim of addressing these issues: one based on a checklist, one focused on constructing abstract specifications, and the last centered on the route that a use case takes through a system. The three approaches are evaluated empirically and, in this instance, it is suggested that the checklist is the most effective approach, but that the other techniques also have potential strengths. For the best results in a practical situation, a combination of techniques is recommended, one of which should focus specifically on the characteristics of OO.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1223643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223643","","Inspection;Computer Society;Application software;Object oriented modeling;Power system modeling;Large-scale systems;Industrial control;Testing;Encapsulation;Libraries","","33","","20","IEEE","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Measuring Class Cohesion Based on Client Similarities Between Method Pairs: An Improved Approach That Supports Refactoring","M. Alzahrani","Department of Computer Science, Albaha University, Albaha, Saudi Arabia",IEEE Access,"29 Dec 2020","2020","8","","227901","227914","Class cohesion is an important quality attribute that has an impact on other quality attributes such understandability, testability, and maintainability. Therefore, classes with low cohesion should be refactored in order to improve their overall qualities. Many cohesion metrics have been introduced in the literature to automatically assess the quality of the class and support refactoring activities. Most existing metrics measure the class cohesion based on how the methods of a class are internally related to each other, while a few metrics measure the class cohesion based on how the methods are externally used by the clients of the class. Unfortunately, the existing client-based cohesion metrics cannot automatically support refactoring techniques such as the Extract Class refactoring. Therefore, this article proposes a new client-based cohesion metric that can be used to automatically identify Extract Class refactoring opportunities. The proposed metric is theoretically evaluated by proving the compliance of the metric to the mathematical cohesion properties, while it is empirically evaluated by conducting a large case study on three systems to compare the metric with other cohesion metrics. Finally, the paper introduces and evaluates an Extract Class refactoring approach based the proposed cohesion metric.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300041","Software engineering;software measurement;cohesion metrics;code refactoring","Measurement;Volume measurement;Data mining;Coherence;Automation;Time measurement","","2","","41","CCBY","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A real example is the plagiarism of assignments during the lecture process. One of the efforts to prevent plagiarism is to use a system that has been developed in recent years. However, the price of subscribing to the system for a period is quite high. Therefore, we need a plagiarism detection system that everyone can access for free. In developing the system, of course, modeling must be done. Two popular algorithms are often used to detect word similarity: Rabin-Karp and Winnowing. In this study, a performance comparison was made between Rabin-Karp and Winnowing. Comparisons were made using the same dataset of 30 abstraction data from scientific publications. Based on the research, the performance of the Rabin-Karp algorithm and the Winnowing algorithm is almost as good. However, based on the two evaluation parameters used by the Winnowing algorithm, it produces more similarity scores than Rabin-Karp. The same thing also applies to the evaluation of processing time. Winnowing is slightly longer than Rabin-Karp. With the results of this comparison, it can be concluded that if you want a model sensitive to similarity, then Winnowing is recommended. However, if processing time is the target, it is recommended to use Rabin-Karp. In future research, tuning the parameter values of k or n in the Rabin-Karp and Winnowing algorithms is recommended. In addition, it is also recommended to experiment with another distance scoring.","","978-1-6654-7327-9","10.1109/ICIMCIS56303.2022.10017488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017488","Text Similarity;Winnowing;Rabin-Karp;Jaccard Coefficient;Cosine Similarity","Plagiarism;Multimedia systems;Informatics;Tuning;Testing","","1","","28","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We solve this problem by proposing a novel program synthesis based approach, SynEva, that can systematically construct an oracle-alike mirror program for similarity measurement, and automatically compare it with the existing knowledge on new scenarios to decide how the knowledge suits the new scenarios. SynEva is lightweight and fully automated. Our experimental evaluation with real-world data sets validates SynEva's effectiveness by strong correlation and little overhead results.

To tolerate faults, both of these techniques rely on design diversity, i.e. the availability of multiple implementations of a specification. Software engineers assume that the different implementations use different designs and, thereby, it is hoped, contain different faults. Our study uses a novel method of incorporating diversity in the development of one version of the software. We term this approach the pipeline method of software development.

Previous experimental research has shown that evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be applied successfully to find UIOs on some instances. However, before EAs can be recommended as a practical technique for computing UIOs, it is necessary to better understand the potential and limitations of these algorithms on this problem. In particular, more research is needed in determining for what instances of the problem EAs are feasible. This paper presents a rigorous runtime analysis of the (1+1) EA on three classes of instances of this problem.

The sparse attention mechanism boosts computational efficiency and interpretability, allowing focus on critical data points for prediction. RMSNorm normalizes the neural network's outputs, improving training stability and convergence speed. The model effectively captures intricate exercise dependencies through self-attention and sparse attention.

A joint label consistent embedding and dictionary learning approach is proposed for delivering a linear sparse codes auto-extractor and a multi-class classifier by simultaneously minimizing the sparse reconstruction, discriminative sparse-code, code approximation and classification errors. The auto-extractor is characterized with a projection that bridges signals with sparse codes by learning special features from input signals for characterizing sparse codes. The classifier is trained based on extracted sparse codes directly. In our setting, the performance of the classifier depends on the discriminability of sparse codes, and the representation power of the extractor depends on the discriminability of input sparse codes, so we incorporate label information into the dictionary learning to enhance the discriminability of sparse codes. So, for inductive classification, our model forms an integration process from test signals to sparse codes and finally to assigned labels, which is essentially different from existing sparse coding based approaches that involve an extra sparse reconstruction with the trained dictionary for each test signal.

With the path towards Exascale, new HPC runtime systems are also emerging in a way that differs from classical distributed computing models. However, system software for such capabilities on the latest extreme-scale DOE supercomputing needs to be enhanced to more appropriately support these types of emerging software ecosystems. In this paper, we propose the use of Virtual Clusters on advanced supercomputing resources to enable systems to support not only HPC workloads, but also emerging big data stacks. Specifically, we have deployed the KVM hypervisor within Cray's Compute Node Linux on a XC-series supercomputer testbed. We also use libvirt and QEMU to manage and provision VMs directly on compute nodes, leveraging Ethernet-over-Aries network emulation. To our knowledge, this is the first known use of KVM on a true MPP supercomputer. We investigate the overhead our solution using HPC benchmarks, both evaluating single-node performance as well as weak scaling of a 32-node virtual cluster. Overall, we find single node performance of our solution using KVM on a Cray is very efficient with near-native performance. However overhead increases by up to 20% as virtual cluster size increases, due to limitations of the Ethernet-over-Aries bridged network. Furthermore, we deploy Apache Spark with large data analysis workloads in a Virtual Cluster, effectively demonstrating how diverse software ecosystems can be supported by High Performance Virtual Clusters.","2168-9253","978-1-5386-2326-8","10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8048942","hpc;kvm;vm;virtual machines;virtual clusters;virtualization;supercomputer;cray;hpcg;spark;apache","Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization;Hardware;Big Data;Cloud computing;Computational modeling","","2","","49","IEEE","25 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the indexing viewpoint, this metric presents two major challenges: (a) it does not lead to any natural indexable ""features"", and (b) comparing two sequences requires time quadratic in the sequence length. To address each problem, we propose to use: (a) a modification of the so called ""FastMap"", to map sequences into points, with little compromise of ""recall"" (typically zero); and (b) a fast linear test, to help us discard quickly many of the false alarms that FastMap will typically introduce.

Currently, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)-based structural covariance networks usually only consider interactions between pairs of brain regions at the individual level, and do not take into account higher-order relationships between multiple brain regions or subjects. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the group sparse radiomics representation network (GSR2N) which utilizes group sparse representation (GSR) instead of traditional Pearson correlation (PC) construction method. This reduces inter-individual differences in network topology and accounts for mixing effects among multiple brain regions. We conducted extensive experiments using the ADNI and AIBL dataset on triple graph convolutional network (TGCN) to compare the classification performance of different network construction methods. The results demonstrate that GSR method has the highest classification performance, with intra and inter-dataset test accuracies of 0.894 and 0.856, respectively.

Second, because the A-scans appear as a sparse signal of spikes, it is possible to formulate the time-domain SAFT algorithm in a new fashion that is both faster compared to conventional SAFT and the deconvolved input data can be focussed better leading to a higher resolution. Since sparse deconvolution could be implemented directly into the ultrasonic probe hardware/software measurement setup, this approach can significantly speed up measurements in time-critical environments.

A video frame is usually split into blocks that are predicted and subtracted from the original, which leaves a residual. These blocks are transformed by integer discrete sine transform (IntDST) or integer discrete cosine transform (IntDCT), quantized, and entropy coded into a bitstream. In contrast to camera captured content, screen content contains a lot of similar and repeated blocks. The HEVC-SCC tools utilize these similarities in various ways. After these tools are executed, the remaining signals are handled by IntDST/IntDCT which is designed to code camera-captured content. Fortunately, in sparse coding, the dictionary learning process which uses these residuals adapts much better and the outcome is significantly sparser than for camera captured content. This paper proposes a sparse coding scheme which takes advantage of the similar and repeated intra prediction residuals and targets low to mid frequency/energy blocks with a low sparsity setup. We also applied an approach which splits the common test conditions (CTC) sequences into categories for training and testing purposes. It is integrated as an alternate transform where the selection between traditional transform and our proposed method is based on a rate-distortion optimization (RDO) decision.

In this paper, focusing on traffic sign recognition tasks, we empirically analyze the impact of diversity parameter estimations for predicting the reliability of three-version traffic sign classifier systems. Using five real-world traffic sign datasets, we confirm that the three-version architecture effectively enhances system reliability by applying diverse models and diversified input images. Then, we estimate the diversity parameters and apply them to variants of reliability prediction models. The prediction residuals between the observed reliability and the predicted reliability are mostly less than 0.017 across all data sets, which is half of the residual achieved by the conventional prediction model, except for the architecture of a single model with triple input.

At present, most of the methods to solve the problem of multi-label emotion recognition focus on analyzing the semantics of the text, ignoring the semantic information brought by emotion tags, and not modeling the semantic relationship between emotion labels and text. In this paper, a method of multi-label emotion recognition based on label similarity attention mechanism is proposed. In this method, bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used to obtain the context knowledge of the text, so as to achieve the purpose of learning the global information of the text. The label features are learned by the label encoder. The label similarity attention mechanism is used to obtain the correlation matrix between the label and the word representation, and further strengthen the semantic information. At the same time, CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) is used to obtain local semantic information. The semantic representation of sentences is enriched. Finally, emotion recognition is carried out through the classifier. In the classifier, this paper proposes a joint loss function, which enables the model to learn the emotional characteristics of texts and labels at the same time. The model combines the global and local information of the text to show the semantic relationship between the text and the emotional label.

To identify two words based on how they are pronounced require more efforts rather than simply testing character by character comparison. The solution to identify phonetic equality between two or more words is somehow tricky. Solution for this problem is achieved by applying a set of rules on the given word. English language is versatile language having many such words also known as homophone describes the rules for phonetic identification.

When two adjacent objective vectors are similar but the difference in the corresponding decision vectors is large, it is difficult to transfer from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems. In this article, we argue that the key to overcoming this difficulty is the evaluation assignment for different subproblems based on local density and global utility. We propose a local-density measurement model to estimate the solution density around each subproblem. Based on the model, a local-diversity evaluation assignment strategy for the decomposition-based MOEA is designed to assign fitness evaluations among different subproblems. Two discrete MOPs are selected as test instances for experiments because they satisfy the premise that the difference in the corresponding decision vectors of adjacent objective vectors is large. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy enhances the population diversity. Besides, the combination of the proposed strategy and the evaluation assignment for high global utility subproblems can overcome the difficulty in transferring from a solution of one subproblem to solutions of its neighboring subproblems.

One of the features is an indoor navigation feature based on Augmented Reality (AR). However, the route from one point to another is not always straightforward. Therefore, this research will design and develop an application which aims to detect obstacles present in the route from starting point to ending point. Obstacles that can be detected in this application are 3D objects, classified as human, bag, chair, potted plant and table or desk. In the application, TensorFlow Lite is used to detect obstacles in the form of 3D objects, where the distance is calculated using a triangle similarity method. Once an object is identified, the application will provide sound/voice notification, vibration as well as augmented reality image on the screen to inform the user about the obstacle. This is done by having ARCore Software Development Kit. To evaluate the system, tests were carried out which included walking speed limit testing, and usability testing. In the walking speed limit test, the maximum speed when using the application is in the range of 1.27 m/s to 1.35 m/s.

Sparse LU factorization can be expedited by utilizing the supernode structure, which partitions the matrix into dense sub-matrices, thereby improving computational performance by utilizing level-3 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operations. The sparse and irregular structure of circuit matrices often impedes the formation of supernodes or results in the formation of supernodes with many zero elements, which in turn poses challenges for exploiting GEMM operations. In this paper, by fully utilizing the density in sub-matrices and combining GEMM with the Dense-Sparse Matrix Multiplication (SpMM), we propose a density-aware adaptive matrix multiplication equipped with machine learning techniques to optimize performance of the most-time consuming matrix multiplication operator so as to accelerate the sparse LU factorization. Numerical experiment results show that among the 6 circuit matrices tested, the average performance of matrix multiplication in our algorithm can be improved by 5.35x (up to 9.35x) compared to the performance of using GEMM directly in Schur-complement updates.

Additionally, they ignore the influence of spatial distances between the test image and training basis images on optimal reconstruction coefficients. Consequently, they cannot offer a satisfactory performance in practical face hallucination applications. In this paper, we propose a weighted adaptive sparse regularization (WASR) method to promote accuracy, stability and robustness for face hallucination reconstruction, in which a distance-inducing weighted ℓq norm penalty is imposed on the solution. With the adjustment to shrinkage parameter q , the weighted ℓq penalty function enables elastic description ability in the sparse domain, leading to more conservative sparsity in an ascending order of q . In particular, WASR with an optimal q > 1 can reasonably represent the less sparse nature of noisy images and thus remarkably boosts noise robust performance in face hallucination. Various experimental results on standard face database as well as real-world images show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective metrics and visual quality.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2290574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6662396","Super-resolution;face hallucination;adaptive sparse regularization;weighted penalty;ℓq norm;$\ell_{q}$ norm;adaptive sparse regularization;face hallucination;super-resolution;weighted penalty","Face;Training;Dictionaries;Noise;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Noise measurement","","82","1","27","IEEE","12 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, this assumption could often be violated in real applications due to the presence of noise, limited access to data, equipment malfunction, and so on. Most of the previous methods will cease to work when missing values in one or multiple views occur, thus an incomplete-data oriented dimension reduction becomes an important issue. To this end, we mathematically formulate the above-mentioned issue as sparse low-rank representation through multiview subspace (SRRS) learning to impute missing values, by jointly measuring intraview relations (via sparse low-rank representation) and interview relations (through common subspace representation). Moreover, by exploiting various subspace priors in the proposed SRRS formulation, we develop three novel dimension reduction methods for incomplete multiview data: 1) multiview subspace learning via graph embedding; 2) multiview subspace learning via structured sparsity; and 3) sparse multiview feature selection via rank minimization. For each of them, the objective function and the algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem are elaborated, respectively. We perform extensive experiments to investigate their performance on three types of tasks including data recovery, clustering, and classification. Both two toy examples (i.e., Swiss roll and S-curve) and four real-world data sets (i.e., face images, multisource news, multicamera activity, and multimodality neuroimaging data) are systematically tested. As demonstrated, our methods achieve the performance superior to that of the state-of-the-art comparable methods.

Existing techniques detect ponzitracts by analyzing the code as well as a large amount of transaction data after time-consuming deployment. However, a conclusion based on transaction data can only be gotten after the damage has been caused. This paper proposes PonziDetector, a ponzitract detection technique that does not rely on transaction data. Behavior forest is introduced into PonziDetector to capture dynamic behaviors of smart contracts during interacting with them, which makes it possible to early detect ponzitracts. The empirical study demonstrates that PonziDetector, without transaction data, can improve the precision and the recall of the state-of-the-art to 94.6% and 93.0% respectively.

Image features are directly extracted instead of using OCR (optical character recognition). The proposed method forms so-called vertical bar patterns by detecting local extrema points in word units extracted by segmenting the document images. These vertical bar patterns form the feature vector of a document. The pair-wise similarity of document images is measured by calculating the scalar product of two document feature vectors. The proposed method is robust to changing fonts and styles, and is less affected by degradation of document qualities. To test the validity of the method, four corpora of document images were used and the ability of the method to retrieve relevant documents is reported.","","0-7695-1263-1","10.1109/ICDAR.2001.953868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953868","","Optical character recognition software;Shape;Image recognition;Text recognition;Feature extraction;Character recognition;Image segmentation;Robustness;Degradation;Testing","","","1","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically the best match (among a set of prestored objects) is assumed to be the correct match. This may work well in controlled environments (closed world). But, in uncontrolled environments (open world), the test object may not belong to the prestored object classes. In uncontrolled environments, a metric similarity measure (e.g. Euclidean) in conjunction with a threshold is used. However, based on psychophysical studies this is very different from, and far inferior to, human capabilities. To accept or reject a match, we introduce an approach that avoids metric similarity measures and the use of thresholds as it attempts to employ similarity measures used by humans. In the absence of sufficient real data, the approach allows to specifically generate an arbitrarily large number of training exemplars projecting near classification boundary. For aircraft detection, the performance of a neural network trained on such a training set, was comparable to that of a human expert, and far better than a network trained only on the available real data. Furthermore, the results were considerably better than those obtained using a Euclidean discriminator.","","0-7803-5467-2","10.1109/ICIP.1999.821690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821690","","Computer aided software engineering;Humans;Anthropometry;Object recognition;Testing;Military aircraft;Databases;Laboratories;Image recognition;Psychology","","","","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, it is shown that much better generalization can be obtained by using a variable interpolation kernel in combination with conjugate gradient optimization of the similarity metric and kernel size. The resulting method is called variable-kernel similarity metric (VSM) learning. It has been tested on a number of standard classification data sets, and on these problems it shows better generalization than backpropagation and most other learning methods. An important advantage is that the system can operate as a black box in which no model minimization parameters need to be experimentally set by the user. The number of parameters that must be determined through optimization are orders of magnitude less than for backpropagation or RBF networks, which may indicate that the method better captures the essential degrees of variation in learning.","","0-7803-1421-2","10.1109/IJCNN.1993.713963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=713963","","Kernel;Learning systems;Interpolation;Neural networks;Testing;Optimization methods;Training data;Computer science;Application software;Radial basis function networks","","","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, DL methods still need to overcome the issues of overfitting and data insufficiency. In the current study, we propose a stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE) based feature encoding algorithm. The proposed SSAE effectively trains on a small-scale data and computes the significant feature representation for PD diagnosis.

First, the landslides and environmental factors are collected, and frequency ratios of environmental factors are calculated as the model inputs. Second, the input data are passed through the input layer with the dropout, and then, the features are passed through the hidden layers, that is, the k% lifetime sparsity layers. The hidden layers are employed to further sparse these factors to obtain the independent and redundant prediction features as much as possible. Finally, certain classifiers are used to realize the LSP in the study area. SFE-support vector machine (SVM), SFE-logistic regression (LR), and SFE-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models are built. For comparison, principal component analysis (PCA)-SVM, PCA-LR, PCA-SGD, SVM, LR, and SGD models are also built for LSP in Shicheng County, China.

Our goal is to elucidate the nonlinear dynamics and interactions among key parameters contributing to PID susceptibility. PID susceptibility was determined to be significantly affected by temperature, relative humidity, voltage bias, and leakage current based on a thorough literature review. The model captures the nonlinear dynamics and interactions among the factors contributing to PID susceptibility with an MAE ≈ 0.35 and RMSE = 0.40. Temperature, relative humidity, voltage bias, and leakage current all significantly affected PID susceptibility. Temperature and relative humidity have the greatest influence, but their interactions are equally important. Voltage bias has a relatively small effect on PID degradation susceptibility, but it cannot be ignored.

System configurations are suggested that improve the system performance in both the forward and reverse direction.

Subsequently, the system performance is tested for the IS-54 standard format structure. DDT shows promise in the reduction of both the power consumption and implementation costs of indoor wireless systems.","","90-5199-193-2","10.1109/WNCMF.1994.530769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=530769","","System performance;Transmitting antennas;Diversity methods;Delay systems;Application software;Base stations;Computer simulation;System testing;Energy consumption;Costs","","2","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The Use of Analytical Methods to Maximize the Performance of Divers' Breathing Apparatus","M. Nuckols; P. Sexton","U.S. Naval Coastal System Center, Panama City, Florida, USA; NA",OCEANS 1984,"9 Sep 2010","1984","","","527","531","The use of computer simulation in the design, development, and testing of complex military hardware systems has become increasingly widespread throughout the research and development community. A breathing system simulator for diver life support equipment has been developed which makes possible the modular ""construction"" of any conceivable breathing gas system from a bank of computer memory-resident components. This paper discusses the application of this analytical tool to optimize the conceptual design of an advanced diver underwater breathing apparatus. Design and environmental parameters are evaluated to determine their effects on the overall system performance. A ""best"" design is proposed based on this analysis method for a lung-powered breathing apparatus.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.1984.1152307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1152307","","Performance analysis;Computer simulation;Military computing;System testing;Hardware;Research and development;Computational modeling;Modular construction;Application software;Design optimization","","","","2","IEEE","9 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
