In academia, the stability and accuracy properties of PHIL simulations are often evaluated using the transfer functions of the open- or closed-loop systems. The results are then used to design the interfacing algorithm that couples the hardware with the software side. But this approach typically requires detailed prior knowledge, which is frequently different from practical applications where little or no information is available about the hardware under test. Lacking a benchmark model, it is therefore rather difficult to predict what accuracy can be achieved in practice with a given interface. To avoid modeling all components of the PHIL system, this paper aims to establish the interpretation of the interfacing algorithm as an isolated two-port network. Considering the inputs and outputs as vectors, it is shown how the transmission properties of PHIL interfaces can be predicted for different frequencies and steady-state inputs. In addition, a new measure for evaluating the accuracy via the cosine similarity is proposed, which automatically combines the amplitude and phase characteristics in the calculation. Finally, simulations illustrate the applicability of the presented methodology.","2831-3658","979-8-3503-2700-7","10.1109/eGrid58358.2023.10380883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10380883","Accuracy;cosine similarity;interfacing algorithm;power-hardware-in-the-loop;real-time simulation","Simulation;Current measurement;Software algorithms;Transfer functions;Prediction algorithms;Hardware;Stability analysis","","","","17","IEEE","9 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer aided design, however, might speed up the process significantly. Quality-diversity evolutionary approaches optimise for novelty as well as performance, and can be used to generate a repertoire of diverse designs. This design repertoire could be used as a tool to guide a designer and kick-start the rapid prototyping process. This paper explores this idea in the context of mechanical linkage based robots. These robots can be a good test-bed for rapid prototyping, as they can be modified quickly for swift iterations in design. We compare three evolutionary algorithms for optimising 2D mechanical linkages: 1) a standard evolutionary algorithm, 2) the multi-objective algorithm NSGA-II, and 3) the quality-diversity algorithm MAP-Elites. Some of the found linkages are then realized on a physical hexapod robot through a prototyping process, and tested on two different floors. We find that all the tested approaches, except the standard evolutionary algorithm, are capable of finding mechanical linkages that creates a path similar to a specified desired path. However, the quality-diversity approaches that had the length of the linkage as a behaviour descriptor were the most useful when prototyping. This was due to the quality-diversity approaches having a larger variety of similar designs to choose from, and because the search could be constrained by the behaviour descriptors to make linkages that were viable for construction on our hexapod platform.","","978-1-6654-8768-9","10.1109/SSCI51031.2022.10022197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10022197","Robots;Mechanical linkages;Evolutionary algorithms;Quality-Diversity","Couplings;Legged locomotion;Design automation;Evolutionary computation;Rapid prototyping;Robots;Standards","","","","29","IEEE","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method involves multiple images to model the relationships among the local and global similarities in a unified CRF during training, while combines multi-scale local similarities as the predicted similarity in testing.

In this work, we are developing a theoretical perspective of the benefits involved in using information similarity for MTL. To this end, we first propose an upper bound on the generalization error by implementing the Wasserstein distance as the similarity metric. This indicates the practical principles of applying the similarity information to control the generalization errors.

Despite advances in complex tasks such as object tracking, human behavior modeling, activity recognition, and trajectory planning, the fundamental challenge of interpretable scene understanding, especially in out-of-distribution environments, remains evident. This is highlighted by the 84% of AV disengagements attributed to scene understanding errors in real-world AV tests.

Given its rapid invasion and propensity for widespread metastasis, prompt and accurate diagnosis, followed by immediate intervention, is imperative. Fine-grained classification tasks are particularly pertinent in this context, aiming to discern between closely resembling subclasses, a challenge akin to differentiating subtle visual nuances among similar-appearing skin pathologies. Consequently, fine-grained classification emerges as a critical tool in the nuanced diagnosis, early detection, and ongoing surveillance of skin diseases.

It helps to accelerate the design and optimization of a coil. However, the existing calculation models for the key equivalent parameters, the inductance ( $L$ ) and the capacitance ( $C$ ), of the solenoid coils can only provide estimations for standard tightly wound cylindrical coils, and the accuracy is not high. There are no accurate models available for calculating  $L$ ,  $C$ , and the resonant frequency when a solenoid becomes irregular, e.g., when it is sparse (with a large pitch), when it has nonuniform pitches, or when it is noncylindrical. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate model for such an irregular solenoid coil to calculate its inductance, capacitance, and, thus, the resonant frequency. The accuracy of the proposed model is tested on the solenoid coils (with large pitches, nonuniform pitches, or noncylindrical shape) by comparing the calculated results to those using commercial simulation software and the measurement results. For a sparsely wound solenoid, the proposed model provides an accurate calculation of the inductance with a maximal pitch-to-wire-diameter ratio of 40 (an error rate of 8.33% at this ratio).

Since assignments turned in by computer science students can be in a variety of languages, we work at the syntactic level and do not consider the source-code semantics. Consequently, the approach we propose is endogenous and makes no assumption about the programming language being analysed. It is based on an alignment method using the parallel principle at local resolution (character level) to compute similarities between documents. We tested our framework on hundreds of real source files, involving a wide array of programming languages (Java, C, Python, PHP, Haskell, bash). Our approach allowed us to discover previously undetected frauds, and to empirically evaluate its accuracy and robustness.","","978-1-4244-8655-7","10.1109/SCAM.2010.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601829","Endogenous;Plagiarism Detection;Similarity Measure;Distance;Source Code Segmentation;Source Code Plagiarism","Cloning;Plagiarism;Computer languages;Context;Robustness;Software systems","","31","","24","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If used maliciously, deepfakes can have devastating consequences on society such as cyberbullying, scamming, and spreading false and vindictive news which pose serious threats to individuals as well as to the nation by disrupting its peace and security, etc. Hence, developing techniques to detect manipulated media is of utmost urgency and importance.

"The Paradigm of Granular Rough Computing: Foundations and Applications","L. Polkowski","Polish Japanese Institute of Information Technology, Warsaw, Poland",6th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics,"8 Oct 2007","2007","","","145","153","Granular rough computing is a paradigm within rough computing which in turn can be set within the realm of cognitive informatics, i.e. machine intelligence tools which emulate cognitive processes in living organisms; its aim is to compute with granules of knowledge that are collective objects formed from individual objects by means of a similarity measure. In this work, we apply the formalism for granule formation proposed by us and studied over last few years which is based on similarity measures called Rough Inclusions. A proper study of rough inclusions has been done within Rough Mereology, a paradigm for approximate reasoning that is rooted in the theory of concepts called Mereology based on the notion of a part instead on the notion of an element like the naive concept theory. We give an outline of granulation theory based on rough inclusions; then, we discuss the most important consequence of similarity among objects in a granule, viz., the hypothesis that granules represent new objects, which preserve the most important features of objects in a granule. This leads to the notion of a granular decision system obtained by means of granulation from an original decision system. The hypothesis that granular decision systems reflect properties of original decision systems to a satisfactory degree, put forth by the author at 2005 and 2006 IEEE GrC conferences, has been tested with very good results. We include here some results of those tests. Further results are included in the paper by Polkowski and Artiemjew [29] in these Proceedings.","","978-1-4244-1327-0","10.1109/COGINF.2007.4341885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341885","Granules of knowledge;Rough sets;Similarity;Rough inclusions;Granular systems","Computer applications;Logic;Cognitive informatics;Uncertainty;Information systems;Set theory;Application software;Information technology;Mathematics;Computer science","","11","","44","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing analysis methods either resort to physically sieving rock samples, or using image analysis software. The currently available software systems for this problem typically work with 2D images and often require a significant amount of time by skilled human operators, particularly to accurately delineate rock fragments. Recent research into 3D image processing promises to overcome many of the issues with analysis of 2D images of rock fragments. However, for many mines it is not feasible to replace their existing image collection systems and there is still a need to improve on methods used for analysing 2D images. This paper proposes a method for delineation of rock fragments using compressed Haar-like features extracted from small image patches, with classification by a support vector machine. The optimum size of image patches and the numbers of compressed features have been determined empirically. Delineation results for images of rocks were superior to those obtained using the watershed algorithm with manually assigned markers. Using compressed features is demonstrated to improve the computational efficiently such that a machine learning solution is viable.","","978-9-8975-8133-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7294834","Compressed Sensing;Random Projections;Sparse Representation;Image Patches;Feature Extraction;Image Segmentation;Classification","Rocks;Image coding;Feature extraction;Training;Support vector machines;Image edge detection;Accuracy","","","","27","","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel graphical algorithm that integrates the dynamic time warping (DTW)-D measure into the birth-death Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BDMCMC) methodology (DTWD-BDMCMC) is proposed for modeling the intrinsic correlations buried in data. The DTW-D, which is the ratio of DTW over the Euclidean distance (ED), is targeted to calibrate the warping observation sequences. The approach of the BDMCMC is a Bayesian framework used for structure learning in sparse graphical models. In detail, a modified DTW-D distance matrix is first developed to construct a weighted covariance instead of the traditional covariance calculated with the ED. We then build on Bayesian Gaussian models with the weighted covariance with the aim to be robust against problems of sequence distortion. Moreover, the weighted covariance is used as limited prior information to facilitate an initial graphical structure, on which we finally employ the BDMCMC for the determination of the reconstructed Gaussian graphical model. This initialization is beneficial to improve the convergence of the BDMCMC sampling. We implement our method on broad simulated data to test its ability to deal with different kinds of graphical structures. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with its rivals, as it is competitively applied to Gaussian graphical models and copula Gaussian graphical models. In addition, we apply our method to explore real-network attacks and genetic expression data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849213","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502261,61572457,61379132); Key Research and Development Plan Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2016GGX101032); Science, Technology Plan Project for Colleges and Universities of Shandong Province(grant numbers:J14LN85); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2017PF013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396215","Bayesian model selection;birth-death process;dynamic time warping;graphical structure learning;G-Wishart;Markov chain Monte Carlo","Graphical models;Euclidean distance;Bayes methods;Covariance matrices;Markov processes;Data models;Monte Carlo methods","","","","29","OAPA","26 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes rpcPRF, a multiplane image (MPI)-based planar neural radiance field for rational polynomial camera (RPC), exhibits robust performance even with single or sparse inputs. Unlike coordinate-based NeRFs that require sufficient views of one scene, our model can be applied to new scenes and has shown positive results for single or sparse test images. This allows for generalization across various scenes. To achieve generalization across scenes, we use reprojection supervision to ensure that the predicted MPI accurately captures the geometry between the 3-D coordinates and the images. In addition, we have obviated the requisite for dense depth supervision in multiview-stereo-based methods by introducing rendering techniques of radiance fields. rpcPRF combines the superiority of implicit representations and the advantages of the RPC model, to capture the continuous altitude space while learning the 3-D structure. On the DFC2019 dataset with sparse input of the same scene, rpcPRF achieves the best results. On the TLC dataset and the SatMVS3D dataset with changing scenes in every batch, rpcPRF outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by a significant margin in terms of image fidelity, reconstruction accuracy, and efficiency, for both single-view and multiview tasks.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3382537","Special Funds for Creative Research Grant(grant numbers:2022C61540); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10480403","Multiplane image (MPI);neural radiance field (NeRF);novel view synthesis;rational polynomial camera (RPC)","Three-dimensional displays;Rendering (computer graphics);Cameras;Costs;Image reconstruction;Geometry;Estimation","","","","44","IEEE","27 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU. Thus, introducing GPU based optimization algorithm to the plagiarism detection gives a real solution while handling a large number of data for inter-document plagiarism detection.","","978-1-4799-1876-8","10.1109/ICIINFS.2015.7399044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7399044","CPU;GPU;NVIDIA;CUDA;Jaccard similarity;vector space model;hashing strategy;thread;block","Acceleration;Instruction sets;Phased arrays;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Parallel processing;Yttrium","","3","","24","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ExaPPC is the first large-scale paraphrase dataset used in Persian paraphrase detection to the best of our knowledge. There are 2.3M labeled sentence pairs in the corpus consisting of a 1M paraphrase label and 1.3M non-paraphrase label. Efforts were made manually and semi-automatically to construct this corpus using techniques such as subtitle alignment, translating existing parallel English-Persian corpus and similarity corpus on English tweets. In addition to enriching the corpus, candidate sentence pairs among tweets have been extracted via NLP tools and labeled by two Persian native speakers. The advantages of this corpus compared to the existing ones are the number of pair sentences, sentence Length variation and textual diversity, including formal and dialogue sentences. The result on the provided test corpus shows that ExaPPC achieves 94% accuracy on paraphrase detection task.

Most brilliant and creative writers have been affected by Quranic styles, vocabularies, structures, and meanings. This paper attempts to measure this effectiveness by matching similar language units with the Quranic language units. This similarity expands all over the linguistic analysis levels (morphological, syntactical, and semantic levels). Then identifies them with their positions in the text and clarifies the similarity automatically. A suggested tool called Detection Quran Quotation (DQQ) is able to accomplish this. DQQ can also be useful in the researches which discover quoted texts, plagiarism, heritage verification, and copyright issues. It will help in many applications, such as text similarities, summarization, and text analysis on all of its levels. In this paper, we explain the architecture of our proposed Quranic quotes detection framework. The DQQ is a framework that takes an Arabic text as an input and outputs the quote ratio results. The framework architecture is the first part of a project and is still under testing.","","978-1-7281-6354-3","10.1109/ACCS-PEIT48329.2019.9062853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9062853","quotation;sentences similarity-plagiarism-copyright issues","Plagiarism;Linguistics;Writing;Vocabulary;Tools;Semantics;Task analysis","","","","12","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work extends the idea of automatic image annotation by using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to provide dense labels through semantic segmentation. We present an improved version the Multilevel Superpixel Segmentation (MSS) algorithm, which repurposes existing sparse labels for images by converting them into the dense labels necessary for training a FCN automatically. Our implementation-Fast-MSS-is demonstrated to perform considerably faster than the original without sacrificing accuracy. To showcase the applicability to benthic ecologists, we validate this method using the Moorea Labeled Coral (MLC) dataset as a benchmark. FCNs are evaluated by comparing their predictions on test images with the corresponding ground-truth sparse labels. Our results indicate that FCNs' perform with accuracies that are suitable for many ecological applications, and can increase even further when trained on dense labels augmented with additional sparse labels provided by a patch-based image classifier. The contributions of this study help move the field of benthic ecology towards more efficient monitoring of coral reefs through entirely automated processes.","0197-7385","978-1-7281-5446-6","10.1109/IEEECONF38699.2020.9389163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389163","Coral Reefs;Marine Images;Semantic Segmentation;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs);Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs);Dense;Sparse;Annotations","Training;Deep learning;Image segmentation;Annotations;Semantics;Classification algorithms;Monitoring","","4","","26","IEEE","9 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design of communication systems can be facilitated using channel modeling. Dual polarized MIMO-LMS channel is complex with many factors influencing the channel. The ionospheric, tropospheric effects along with mobility of the user equipment are some of the parameters that make the LMS channel model unique. Widely used dual polarized LMS MIMO channel model Loo is analyzed. Loo is a statistical model which can analyze statistical parameters of the channel. Thus the models have best captured the ionospheric, tropospheric and fading effects for a LMS system. Critical channel parameters like Scatter plot, Auto correlation function (ACF), Doppler spectrum, Correlation coefficient and Outage capacity has been analyzed and a coding scheme that jointly utilizes space, time and polarization diversities is considered for better reliability.

In this work we present a time-domain traffic model for industrial communication in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, medical (ISM) band based on measurements in an industrial automotive production site. As DSA is usually implemented on Software Defined Radios (SDR), our measurement campaign is based on SDR platforms rather than sophisticated spectrum analyzers. We show through the estimation of the Hurst parameter that industrial wireless traffic possesses inherent self-similarity that could be exploited for efficient DSA. We also show that wireless traffic could be modeled as a semi-Markov model with channel on and off durations Log-normally and Pareto distributed, respectively.

With the rapid growth of this technology, more and more IT services providers compete to offer high-quality and cost-effective cloud services that best fulfill their customers' needs. Given the vast diversity of these offers, the choice of the most appropriate Cloud Service Provider (CSP) became a dilemma that confuses most cloud customers. Many diverged criteria have to be considered to precisely evaluate services offered by several CSPs, some of these criteria cannot be quantified easily such as usability and security. The selection of the best CSP is thus a complex Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem that needs to be addressed efficiently. Previous studies of this problem employed MCDM methods that are either unfeasible when it is difficult or meaningless to quantify alternatives over criteria or computationally expensive and inconsistent when relative preferences of alternatives and criteria are used instead. In this paper, we propose a novel MCDM approach that is feasible, efficient and consistent using relative preferences of criteria and alternatives. The proposed approach incorporates Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Best Worst Method (BWM) to rank CSPs using evaluation criteria characterizing their services. The integrated approach has been tested and validated through a use-case scenario which demonstrates its effectiveness and correctness. We have also compared the proposed approach to the most commonly used MCDM approach, Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms AHP in terms of computational complexity and consistency; hence, it is more efficient and reliable than AHP.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987111","Research Center of College of Computer and Information Sciences (CRC) at King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063529","Cloud computing (CC);cloud service providers (CSPs);multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM);best worst method (BWM);technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS);analytical hierarchical process (AHP)","Cloud computing;Decision making;Reliability;Software as a service;Security;Operating systems;Computational complexity","","79","","75","CCBY","10 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study shows that temperature has a great effect on Iranpsilas network load, so that daily electrical load of Iran is function of the minimum, average and maximum temperatures of the forecasted day and the day before forecasted day too. Finally this paper shows that suitable input variables which can consider the temperature effect on Iran forecasted load in the short term load forecast (STLF) model are minimum, average and maximum temperatures of the forecasted day and the day before forecasted day. This analysis can be extended to all of the other environmental factors such as humidity, wind velocity and weather overlay too. Also this study can be performed for the other entire countries electrical network. It is worthy to say, the thermal model which has been designed based on this study has been tested in extended STLF softwares of Iran and their relative papers which have been written by the authors , have been accepted in some of the other international conferences.","","978-1-4244-1705-6","10.1109/ICIT.2008.4608590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4608590","load forecasting;neural networks;linear regression;correlation;similar days","Correlation;Temperature sensors;Temperature;Meteorology;Cooling;Load forecasting;Load modeling","","20","","33","IEEE","26 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, TSA rejection and mitigation based on sparse domain (TSARM-S) is presented. TSAs affect stationary GPS receivers in applications where precise timing is required, such as cellular communications, financial transactions, and monitoring of the electric power grid. In the present work, higher-order derivatives of the clock bias and clock drift are monitored to reveal TSAs that show up as sparse spike-like events. The smoothness of the attack relates to the derivative order where the sparsity is observed. The proposed method jointly estimates a dynamic solution for GPS timing and rejects clock behavior changes based on such sparse events. An evaluation procedure is presented for two testbeds, namely a commercial receiver and a software-defined radio (SDR). Further, the proposed method is evaluated against real spoofing scenarios available online in the Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT). Combined synthetic and real-data results show an average RMS clock bias error of 12.08 m for the SDR platform, and 45.74 m for the commercial device. Furthermore, the technique is evaluated against state-of-the-art mitigation techniques and in a spoofing-plus-multipath scenario for robustness.

The research is to produce a procedure for experimental making and verification of mathematical virtualized-CS models; the procedure will create a virtual server on a host platform and monitor its performance under heavy load. Virtualization can use hardware and firmware, or software (OS level). This paper considers natural virtualization. Known models are not applicable to virtualized CS, as they cannot run comprehensive analysis to find the most efficient way of initial resource distribution and to optimize such distribution for a particular application. The mathematics this paper uses is the closed queueing networks (CQN). Experiments produced simple models for analyzing various CS structures. To be adaptive, the models use triggers that track and adjust the processing channel power in individual queueing systems (QS) to a particular application. The conclusions present the findings of this research. Experiments prove the obtained results reliable and usable as a flexible tool for studying the virtualization properties when structuring a CS.

Adversaries utilize different means to gain initial access to the target machines, such as phishing emails, vulnerable public-facing software, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), brute-force attacks, and stolen accounts. To combat these threats of ransomware, this paper aims to help researchers gain a better understanding of ransomware application profiles through static analysis, where we identify a list of suspicious indicators and similarities among 727 active ran-somware samples. We start with generating portable executable (PE) metadata for all the studied samples. With our domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis tasks, we introduce some of the suspicious indicators of the structure of ransomware files. We reduce the dimensionality of the generated dataset by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and discover clusters by applying the KMeans algorithm. This motivates us to utilize the one-class classification algorithms on the generated dataset. As a result, the algorithms learn the common data boundary in the structure of our studied ransomware samples, and thereby, we achieve the data-driven similarities.

However, the canonical PSO does not perform well in population diversity maintenance so that usually leads to a premature convergence or local optima. To address this issue, we propose a variant of PSO named Grouping PSO with Personal-Best-Position ($P_{best}$) Guidance (GPSO-PG) which maintains the population diversity by preserving the diversity of exemplars. On one hand, we adopt uniform random allocation strategy to assign particles into different groups and in each group the losers will learn from the winner. On the other hand, we employ personal historical best position of each particle in social learning rather than the current global best particle.

Although lots of machine learning methods have been proposed, great challenges arise with boom of precision medicine. On one hand, many methods are based on the assumption that similar drugs may share same side effects, but measuring the drug-drug similarity appropriately is challenging. One the other hand, multi-source data provide diverse information for the analysis of side effects, and should be integrated for the high-accuracy prediction. In this paper, we tackle the side effect prediction problem through linear neighborhoods and multi-source data integration. In the feature space, linear neighborhoods are constructed to extract the drug-drug similarity, namely “linear neighborhood similarity”. By transferring the similarity into the side effect space, known side effect information is propagated through the similarity-based graph. Thus, we propose the linear neighborhood similarity method (LNSM), which utilizes single-source data for the side effect prediction. Further, we extend LNSM to deal with multi-source data, and propose two data integration methods: similarity matrix integration method (LNSM-SMI) and cost minimization integration method (LNSM-CMI), which integrate drug substructure data, drug target data, drug transporter data, drug enzyme data, drug pathway data and drug indication data to improve the prediction accuracy. The proposed methods are evaluated on the benchmark datasets. The linear neighborhood similarity method (LNSM) can produce satisfying results on the single-source data. Data integration methods (LNSM-SMI and LNSM-CMI) can effectively integrate multi-source data, and outperform other state-of-the-art side effect prediction methods in the cross validation and independent test. The proposed methods are promising for the drug side effect prediction.","","978-1-5090-1611-2","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822555","side effects;data integration;drug-drug similarity","Drugs;Data integration;Biochemistry;Chemicals;Predictive models;Databases;Learning systems","","40","","39","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the proposed scheme, initially, some pre-processing techniques are employed to enhance image quality and extract text-lines from each handwritten document image. For each extracted text-line, a set of 92 features are computed based on analysis of connected component, enclosed region, lower and upper contours, fractal code, and Curve let. Considering the extracted feature vectors, a histogram is created for each feature of every writer as a histogram-valued symbolic data. This process results in a handwriting style model for each individual that consists of a set of histograms. To evaluate the proposed scheme, two different handwritten datasets written in two different scripts (Kannada as an Indian based script and English) were used. The first dataset contains 228 pages written in Kannada by 57 people. The other one is the dataset used in SigWiComp2013 composed of 330 document pages written in English by 55 individuals. The same criteria used in the SigWiComp2013 were followed in our evaluation strategy. Concerning the Kannada dataset, an F-measure of 92.79% was obtained when 114 documents were used in learning stage and the rest (114) were used for testing.

In this work, we exploit the distributed nature of the ground network to employ diversity combining, i.e., we use the ground nodes as a geographically distributed multi-antenna array. However, this causes several research challenges given the limited bandwidth between nodes and the need for accurate synchronization to combine signal copies constructively at a central node. Sending all signal samples from all ground nodes to the central node is prohibitive due to the required data rates in the network. As a novel concept, we propose a system that only forwards selected signal samples belonging to a packet with high probability.

Therefore, this article explores an idea to control the rates of only a few service flows so that the rates of all uncontrolled flows allocated by TCP will meet their QoS requirements. We design a new architecture, called Scalable Per-Flow Rate Allocation (SPFRA), and formulate a new optimization problem, termed Scalable Rate Allocation for Aggregate Flows (SRAF), to find a minimum number of controlled flows to increase the scalability of SDN with diverse service requirements. We prove the NP-hardness and inapproximability of SRAF. To solve the problem, we design an algorithm, named Aggregate Flow Selection and Flow Release (AFSFR), to achieve the tightest bound and extend it to support distributed computation and dynamic traffic for instant services.

The quality of the extracted spatial details plays an important role in the success of a detail injection scheme.

In the proposed method, the spatial details are first extracted from the multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images through à trous wavelet transform and multiscale guided filter. Different from the traditional detail injection scheme, the extracted details are then sparsely represented to produce the primary joint details by dictionary learning from the subimages themselves. To obtain the refined joint details information, we subsequently design an adaptive weight factor considering the correlation and difference between the previous joint details and PAN image details. Finally, the refined joint details are injected into the MS image using modulation coefficient to achieve the fused image. The proposed method has been tested on QuickBird, IKONOS, and WorldView-2 datasets and compared to several state-of-the-art fusion methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

In this case, no orbit determination is possible without previous correlation of observations obtained at different times. This correlation step is the most computationally intensive, and becomes more and more difficult as the number of objects to be discovered increases. In this paper, we tested two different algorithms, and the related prototype software, recently developed to solve the correlation problem for objects in geostationary orbit (GEO). The algorithms allow the accurate orbit determination by full least-squares solutions with all six orbital elements. The presence of a significant subpopulation of high area-to-mass ratio objects in the GEO region, strongly affected by non-gravitational perturbations, required to solve also for dynamical parameters describing these effects, that is to fit between six and eight free parameters for each orbit.The validation was based upon a set of real data, acquired from the European Space Agency (ESA) Space Debris Telescope (ESASDT) at the Teide Observatory (Canary Islands). We proved that it is possible to assemble a set of sparse observations into a set of objects with orbits. This would allow a survey strategy covering the region of interest in the sky just once per night. As a result, it would be possible to significantly reduce the requirements for a future telescope network, with respect to what would have been required with the previously known algorithms for correlation and orbit determination.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19392.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8163526","methods: analytical;methods: data analysis;catalogues;astrometry;celestial mechanics","","","3","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

For a single antenna scenario, it is shown that for the same environments, the COST207 and 3GPP channel models offer almost a similar performance. Moreover, it is found that in the case of indoor channel reception (WLAN profiles) and for a carrier to noise ratio (C/N) of 15-20 dB, the receiver maintains an acceptable level of pcBER for proper audio decoding. This observation also applies to the recently proposed DVB-H multipath channel profiles, except for the motorway rural channel (MR) at 100 km/h where the receiver fails to operate correctly at this mobile speed. In dual-antenna scenarios, the maximal ratio combining (MRC) diversity technique provides a clear improvement to the performance of the dual-antenna based DAB/DMB receiver for all multipath channel profiles tested.

That's why increasing current students' ocean and overall Earth science literacy is so important and a primary goal of the American Meteorological Society (AMS). To this end, the AMS has created a suite of introductory, undergraduate-level courses that have already engaged approximately a hundred thousand students in the Earth sciences. AMS Ocean Studies, AMS Weather Studies, and AMS Climate Studies have been developed by the AMS with support from NSF, NOAA, and NASA and are designed to be adaptable to traditional, hybrid, or online instructional settings. Course components include a comprehensive textbook (ebook only for AMS Climate Studies; printed or ebook options for AMS Ocean and Weather Studies), eInvestigations Manual, course website, faculty website, and a faculty resource CD. Instructors can use these materials in any combination that best suits their needs. The 3rd edition Ocean Studies textbook features topics such as ocean acidification, harmful algal blooms, the use of ocean currents as an alternative energy source, along with a detailed look at the essential role the ocean plays in Earth's climate system. The textbook also reviews the latest technology for monitoring ocean properties including floats and gliders and cabled ocean observatories. The newest version of the climate studies textbook, Our Changing Climate, is currently under revision and was released for the fall 2014 semester. A greater focus on climate change issues as well as new chapters detailing human and ecosystem vulnerabilities to climate change, energy and geopolitical issues, and climate change denial are a few highlights in the new text. Additionally, new findings from the IPCC AR5 report and the USGCRP National Climate Assessment will be included along with mitigation and adaptation solutions to climate change issues. Updated yearly, the eInvestigations Manuals contain 30 laboratory activities and innovatively connects with a third online component, Current Ocean/Weather/Climate Studies, via the RealTime Ocean/Weather/Climate Portals. These online investigations reference data from NOAA, NOS, reports from the IPCC, USGCRP and contain real-world data from other lead scientific organizations. The RealTime Ocean/Weather/Climate Portals is an all-inclusive webpage that provides links to numerous external sources that further engage students. Instructor support materials are available with each course and include a faculty CD that contains a faculty manual with learning objectives and suggestions for course implementation, as well as investigations manual answer forms compatible with any course management system, test bank questions and answers, textbook images, and PowerPoint® presentations for each chapter. The investigations manual answer forms are files compatible with Respondus®, test-generating software for which many institutions are licensed (answer forms are also provided in Respondus® format). The faculty member has the option of delivering questions through their course management system to allow automatic scoring and immediate results for their students. This feature allows for full integration to a college's e-learning environment. AMS Ocean Studies also offers a unique way to study marine science through the use of Google Earth-based animations and other similar data visualization tools, such as NOAA View that allows students to view satellite, model, and other data and export high-resolution images. These tools bring oceanography to life! The AMS believes that students are truly motivated to learn when they can relate to the topic. That is why use of current, real-world data is vital to all three of the courses. A few examples include the 2011 Japan earthquake/tsunami event, the 2012 record-low Arctic sea ice, and Superstorm Sandy. In all of these instances, online activities were created as these events were occurring; students learned the science as it was happening! AMS Ocean Studies, AMS Weather Studies, and AMS Climate Studies can be taught by experienced science faculty or those new to teaching the subject matter. Mentoring by AMS-trained course instructors is available to all new instructors. These courses aim to interest all students in the geosciences and increase scientific literacy through the use of real-world data.","0197-7385","978-1-4799-4918-2","10.1109/OCEANS.2014.7003014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7003014","ocean;climate;water;course;online;diversity","Oceans;Meteorology;Educational institutions;Earth;Manuals;US Government agencies;Conferences","","","","6","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The receiver then extracts multiple versions of each relayed packet via a collision-resolution algorithm, thus realizing the diversity gain of cooperative communication. We demonstrate the feasibility of DAC by prototyping and testing it on the GNURadio/USRP software radio platform. To explore its relevance at the network level, we introduce a DAC-based medium access control (MAC) protocol, and a generic approach to integration of the DAC MAC/PHY layer into a typical routing algorithm. Considering the use of DAC for multiple network flows, we analyze the fundamental tradeoff between the improvement in diversity gain and the reduction in multiplexing opportunities.

Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identiscation or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2017.02.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7921809","tag clustering algorithm;K-means;latent semantic analysis (LSA);min-max similarity (MMS);social tagging","Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Semantics;Tagging;Clustering methods;Web 2.0;Data processing","","12","","","","11 May 2017","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Because model validation plays a key role in system simulation for analysis and optimization of railgun, a novel validation method is proposed in this paper. By utilizing the railgun dynamic test and predicted data, the simulation model is validated based on theil's inequality coefficient (TIC) method. To execute sufficient validation of the model and improve reliability of the validation results, similarity theory is adopted to analyze the credibility of simulation model by comparing the characteristics of the railgun. Inspired by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for multiple attribute decision making, we define the muzzle velocity, current peak and discharging time as evaluation index for assessing the credibility of the simulation model and then evaluation structure is established. The final synthesis results demonstrate the feasibility of the adopted validation method and the validity of the modular model. The whole system model is run under MATLAB software platform, which is divided into several main components encapsulated into classes by object-oriented technology. On the basis of the validated model, an optimization pursuing highest velocity with the constraint of the current peak and the residual current in the rail is carried out to find a set of optimal parameters for the railgun using genetic algorithm.","","978-1-4673-0305-7","10.1109/EML.2012.6325055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6325055","modularized design;model validation;similarity theory;analytic hierarchy process;optimization;genetic algorithm;electromagnetic railgun","Mathematical model;Railguns;Optimization;Rails;Object oriented modeling;Projectiles;Analytical models","","10","","15","IEEE","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenge is how to find the right Web services efficiently and effectively for a given development task. There have been many efforts on developing techniques or systems to search services. Though effective in certain scenarios, existing techniques do not form systems for public use; or are based on one query modal--keyword query, which cannot give the matched services accurately. In this paper, we introduce proposed multimodal query search, where users can use keyword and file as query or custom the query. The multimodal query is based on an innovative similarity measure approach, which incorporates both semantic information and structural information of Web services. Our experiments and test cases validate the effectiveness of the approach. Compared with the alternative system Seekda, it is able to obtain much higher search accuracy with keyword query (with a match rate of 2-4 times higher than that of Seekda). The custom search can achieve 100% top-3 match rate, while Seekda fails in most cases using keywords.","","978-1-4673-2131-0","10.1109/ICWS.2012.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6257817","Web service search;multimodal query;similarity;semantic","Web services;Semantics;Vectors;Documentation;Keyword search;Electronic mail;Accuracy","","4","","33","IEEE","6 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basis sparse-coding inspired similarity (BASIS) descriptor utilizes sparse coding to create dictionary images that model the regions in the human visual cortex. Due to the reduced amount of computation required for computing BASIS descriptors, reduced descriptor size, and the ability to create the descriptors without the use of a floating point, this approach is an excellent candidate for FPGA hardware implementation. The bit-level-accurate BASIS descriptor was tested on a dataset of real aerial images with the task of calculating a frame-to-frame homography and compared to software versions of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and speeded-up robust features (SURF). Experimental results show that the BASIS descriptor outperforms SIFT and performs comparably to SURF on frame-to-frame aerial feature point matching. BASIS descriptors require less memory storage than other descriptors and can be computed entirely in hardware, allowing the descriptor to operate at real-time frame rates on a low-power embedded platform such as an FPGA.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2223631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327642","Computer vision;feature description;feature descriptor;feature detection;feature detector;sparse coding","Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Image color analysis;Image coding;Detectors","","28","","41","IEEE","9 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture based on the resistive random access memory-based crossbar (ReRAM crossbar) is a natural fit for GCN inference. It can reduce the data movements and compute the vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) in analog. However, it requires an unbearable crossbar cost to leverage the massive parallelism exhibited in GCNs. First, this article explores the design space for GCN inference on ReRAM crossbars and presents the first PIM-based GCN accelerator named PIMGCN, PIMGCN employs dense data mapping and a search-execute architecture to take full advantage of the intravertex parallelisms with acceptable crossbars cost. Two scheduling strategies for PIMGCN to maximize the intervertex parallelisms and optimize the pipeline are proposed. The optimal scheduling is reduced to a maximum independent set problem, which is solved by a novel node-grouping algorithm. Second, this article explores the task-irrelevant information in the graphs and proposes an adaptively sparsified GCN network targeted for PIMGCN, which is named as ASparGCN. ASparGCN exploits a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based edge predictor to get edge selection strategies for each GCN layer separately and adaptively in the training stage, and only inferences with the selected edges in the test stage. We design two regularization terms to guide the selection strategies to achieve architecture-friendly sparse graphs for PIMGCN. The overall algorithm-architecture co-design is named as PASGCN. Compared to the state-of-the-art software framework running on Intel Xeon CPU and NVIDIA RTX8000 GPU, PASGCN achieves an average of  $16455\times $  and  $110.7\times $  speedup and 8.0E $+ 06\times $  and 6.67E $+ 03\times $  energy reduction, respectively.

The car is required to avoid a static obstacle or performing double lane change. The problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer optimal control problem (MIOCP). The resulting MIOCP is solved by reformulating it to static mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) using time discretization and direct multiple shooting method. Non-commercial open software packages are applied that substantially use the gradients of the objective function and the Jacobians of the constraints exploiting sparsity. A novel algorithm and implementation is presented for computing the derivatives of the complex state trajectory joining equations. This algorithm was given in the form of matrix differential equations whose structure allowed to compute their solution using RK4 in matrix form. The elaborated method can be applied both for combustion engine and electric driven cars.

The proposed new ICS is realized with diversification of hardware/software and unidirectional communication in alerting suspicious infiltration to upper-level management. Equipped with control bus monitoring, this operation-basis approach of infiltration detection would become a truly cyber-resilient ICS.
