Few others might be regarded as spatial-based (or even spatiotemporal-based) methods, as they take into account the neighborhood of each analyzed pixel. Although the latter types can be viewed as improvements in many cases, most of the methods that have been proposed so far suffer in complexity, processing speed, and/or versatility when compared to their simpler pixel-based counterparts. In this paper, we present an adaptive background subtraction method, derived from the low-cost and highly efficient ViBe method, which uses a spatiotemporal binary similarity descriptor instead of simply relying on pixel intensities as its core component. We then test this method on multiple video sequences and show that by only replacing the core component of a pixel-based method it is possible to dramatically improve its overall performance while keeping memory usage, complexity and speed at acceptable levels for online applications.","1550-5790","978-1-4799-4985-4","10.1109/WACV.2014.6836059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836059","","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Color;Vectors;Video sequences;Lighting;Analytical models;Maintenance engineering","","116","","30","IEEE","23 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In clinical, as the individual difference is an intrinsic feature of ECG, data distribution difference between training and testing data impacts on the accuracy of classifier. Automatic ECG classification satisfied clinical demand is urgently required. QRS is a main waves in a heartbeat. In this paper, we propose a complete framework for individual oriented QRS morphology variation analysis. The original signal is first preprocessed by re-sampling and smoothing, then symbolized by dynamic and static combined method. For similarity measure, an improved information entropy measure function based on the symbolic result is proposed and ECG domain knowledge is well utilized by the function. At last, the entropy function based unsupervised learning algorithm is presented for QRS complex similarity computation. Our algorithm dedicates to the individual data analysis combined with domain knowledge, which is free from any training data and more suitable for application. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed entropy function achieves improvements over the general distance measure functions during QRS similarity measure. The clustering algorithm is effective at recognizing normal and abnormal QRS morphology.","","978-1-5090-1611-2","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822554","","Electrocardiography;Heart beat;Morphology;Time series analysis;Entropy;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms","","","","21","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we align the class centers of the source and target domain by weighting the sample confidence to corresponding centers, to denoise the mislabeled samples. Second, we scatter the predictions of the target domain by minimizing the entropy of intra-class predictions and decreasing the similarity of inter-class distributions, which tackles the class overlap. The proposed method not only aligns the two domains but also increases the separability of the target domain, which results in improved target data classification performance.

The choice of the data structures used in the unique tables strongly affects the performance of BDD packages. Therefore, is important to identify some aspects that may contribute to the performance. We compare several implementations of unique tables intending to find the more efficient implementations for modern BDD packages using integers (as opposed to pointers) to identify nodes.

Unique to our approach is the use of diverse process pairs not only for isolation benefits but also for detection. The architecture uses the comparison of outputs from diverse applications to provide a significant and novel intrusion detection capability. With this technique, we gain the benefits of n-version programming without its controversial disadvantages.

Statistical power and a measure of sensitivity to the true location of the object are the criteria. Parameters are the numbers of 1's in object and image, subtemplate size, and parameters reflecting intensity distortion between template and object. One of the proposed statistics R is much more computationally intensive than the other G. Although R is more powerful than G and the other statistics, G is generally more sensitive to the true object location.

This scheduling is complicated and involves various factors; thus, the shop scheduling problem of a PCB prototyping assembly is regarded as a multiobjective permutation flow shop scheduling problem (MOPFSP). A mathematical model with four objective functions is built based on the characteristics of a PCB prototyping assembly shop. In this article an aggregation-based approach is designed to aggregate multiple objective function values into the similarity of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (sIFSs). This approach is adopted as a fitness function assignment strategy and is combined with the optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) to build a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm: the OFA based on sIFSs (OFA-sIFSs). To verify the performance of OFA-sIFSs, six congress on evolutionary computation benchmark test functions, ten MOPFSP benchmark instances and a practical problem for a PCB prototyping assembly are solved by OFA-sIFSs and three state-of-the-art algorithms. Three types of similarity measures are evaluated. During the process of testing, four performance metrics, statistical analysis, and business software are employed. The results of this study suggest that OFA-sIFSs can be used to solve the MOPFSP and have better performances compared with the other three algorithms.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2020.2985333","Intelligent Manufacturing Integrated Standardization; New Model Application Project in 2016 of MIIT(grant numbers:(2016) 213); Program of Fuzhou Science and Technology Bureau(grant numbers:2017-G-71); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057375","Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs);multiobjective optimization;multiobjective permutation flow shop scheduling problem (MOPFSP);optimal foraging algorithm (OFA);printed circuit board (PCB) prototyping assembly","Fuzzy sets;Optimization;Job shop scheduling;Linear programming;Mathematical model;Software algorithms","","8","","37","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For many static analyses, malware authors do not even need sophisticated obfuscation techniques to bypass detection, simply compiling with different flags or with a different compiler will suffice. We propose a new static analysis called CARDINAL that is tolerant of the differences in binaries introduced by compiling the same source code with different flags or with different compilers. We accomplished this goal by finding an invariant between these differences. The effective invariant we found is the number of arguments to a call, or call parameter cardinality (CPC). We concatenate all CPC's together per function and input these chains into a Bloom filter. Signatures constructed in this manner can be quickly compared to each other using a Jaccard index to obtain a similarity score. We empirically tested our algorithm on a large corpus of transformed programs and found that using a threshold value of 0.15 for determining a positive or negative match yielded results with a 11% false negative rate and a 11% false positive rate. Overall, we both demonstrate that CPC's are a telling feature that can increase the efficacy of static malware analyses and point the way forward in static analyses.","","978-1-5090-4542-6","10.1109/MALWARE.2016.7888728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888728","Distribution A;Approved for public release;distribution unlimited.","Registers;Malware;Context;Algorithm design and analysis;Optimization;Indexes","","","","14","IEEE","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we develop a predictive Lagrange multiplier estimation method to resolve the chicken and egg dilemma of perceptual-based RDO and apply it to H.264 intra and inter mode decision. Given a perceptual quality level, the resulting video encoder achieves on the average 9% bit-rate reduction for intra-frame coding and 11% for inter-frame coding over the JM reference software.

For most related learning methods, there is a basic assumption that training data should be in identical structure, which does not hold in many situations in practice. In order to learn from training data in different structures, we propose a similarity-based Bayesian learning approach for fault diagnosis in this paper. Our method is to first estimate similarity degrees of structural elements from different log files. Then the basic structure of combined Bayesian network (CBN) is constructed, and the similarity-based learning algorithm is used to compute probabilities in CBN. Finally, test log data can be classified into possible fault categories based on the generated CBN.

Our proposed model takes two patches as input and proceeds to do domain feature extraction for each of them. Features from both domains are then merged with two fusion operations, namely correlation and concatenation.

Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting provides a promising solution to localize an object in indoor environments. Among the factors challenging the RSS fingerprinting based algorithms are the site survey cost and the time-varying environment, given the unreliable signal qualities. Here we present a novel approach to indoor object positioning using the manifold assumption on the radio map in RSS-location space. Thinking the measured RSS from one access point (AP) in different locations are randomly drawn from a nonlinear manifold (ground truth), we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) style algorithm to reconstruct the sparse representation of this manifold from the noisy RSS observations. Motivated by the observation that the radio map has a strong local correlation in the RSS-location space, we introduce a multi-scale constrained quadratic programming to approximate the manifold. Within limited iterations, we can estimate the ground truth RSS values and parameters simultaneously. As a result, the learned manifold is exploited to predict the object's position: we develop a positioning algorithm by minimizing the manifold distortion effort which integrates both measurement error and manifold shape preservation. We conducted extensive simulations and experiments in different settings, testing the datasets collected in a building in the last 8 months. The results showed that the proposed approach was adaptive to the varying environmental noise levels, presenting robust positioning performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8830475","Expectation-maximization;indoor positioning;manifold learning;received signal strength","Manifolds;Wireless fidelity;IP networks;Noise measurement;Robustness;Antenna measurements;Position measurement","","5","","35","CCBY","10 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transmission from devices located deep within buildings or in remote neighborhoods will suffer severe attenuation forcing the use of slow data-rates to reach even the closest gateway, thus resulting in battery drain. This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances both the battery life of client devices and the coverage of LPWANs in large urban deployments. Charm allows multiple LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently combining them to detect weak signals that are not decodable at any individual gateway.

A previous approach [1] proposed a GenetIc Domain Exploration tool (GIDE) that applied a restrictive binding algorithm that mapped applications functions to monolithic accelerators. This approach suffered from lower average application throughput across and reduced platform generality. This paper introduces a Multi-Granularity based Domain Design Space Exploration tool (MG-DmDSE) to improve both average application throughput as well as platform generality. The key contributions of MG-DmDSE are: (1) Applying a multi-granular decomposition of coarse grain application functions into more granular compute kernels. (2) Examining compute similarity between functions in order to produce more generic functions. (3) Configuring monolithic ACCs by selectively bypassing compute elements within them during DSE to expose more functionality. To assess MG-DmDSE, both GIDE and MG-DmDSE were applied to applications in the OpenVX library. MG-DmDSE achieves an average 2.84x greater application throughput compared to GIDE.

Compared to the conventional hashing methods using handcrafted features, emerging deep hashing approaches employ deep neural networks to learn both feature representations and hash functions, which have been proven to be more powerful and robust in real-world applications. Currently, most of the existing deep hashing methods construct pairwise or triplet-wise constraints to obtain similar binary codes between a pair of similar data points or relatively similar binary codes within a triplet. However, we argue that some critical local structures have not been fully exploited. So, this paper proposes a novel deep hashing method named local semantic-aware deep hashing with Hamming-isometric quantization (LSDH), aiming to make full use of local similarity in hash function learning. Specifically, the potential semantic relation is exploited to robustly preserve local similarity of data in the Hamming space.

The computations in such applications usually exhibit superior value locality, i.e., computations performed by a function or code region are very likely to produce “similar” results. Reusing such similar results can bypass redundant computations, as long as “exact” results are not mandatory. However, conventional computation reuse techniques are less effective in approximate computing paradigm. The input values of two computations have to be identical to reuse one for another, hence “exact” in nature. We propose ACR, an approximate computation reuse scheme, to enable computation reuse for approximate computing. ACR relaxes the exact matching requirement in inputs to some extent regulated by “similarity” quantification, thereby shifting the exact computation reuse paradigm to its approximate counterpart. Specifically, using statistical approaches ACR first provides an input significance-aware similarity quantification scheme to calculate similarity between different computations. ACR also provides a regression based branch prediction technique to resolve conditional branches inside a computation. Furthermore, on top of proposed approximate computing framework, ACR presents a parallel implementation of computing engine to carry out branch resolving and similar computation searching. Experimental results show that the ACR scheme could effectively exploit the potential of computation reuse for approximate computing and achieves 3.12 times speedup on average for a set of approximate benchmarks.","2332-7766","","10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2617343","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61522406,61572470,61532017,61432017,61376043,61221062,61521092); Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS(grant numbers:Y404441000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7589994","Approximate computing;computation reuse;similarity quantification;content addressable memory;regression techniques","Approximate computing;Computational modeling;Impedance matching;History;Engines;Benchmark testing;Associative memory","","14","","41","IEEE","13 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies have revealed that they are likely to work together to regulate their common target genes. Discovery of the underlying combinatorial regulation between miRNAs and genes can provide useful information for understanding their functions as well as their close relevance to cancer. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for identifying miRNA-gene regulatory modules by integrating miRNA and mRNA expression profiles and miRNA genomic cluster data. We first develop a multiple-output sparse group lasso (MSGL) regression model to predict a miRNA-gene association matrix (i.e., a miRNA-gene regulatory network). Further, we propose a L0-regularized singular value decomposition (L0-SVD) to identify miRNA-gene joint modules from the predicted regulatory network. We test our method on the matched miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in breast cancer from TCGA project and identify ten miRNA-gene regulatory modules. We find that 1) the modules are significantly associated in the predicted miRNA-gene regulatory network; 2) the modules are significantly enriched in GO biological processes and KEGG pathways, respectively; 3) many miRNAs and genes in the modules are related with breast cancer. On average, 51% of the miRNAs and 30% of the genes are related with breast cancer. The results demonstrate that miRNA-gene regulatory modules provide insights into the mechanisms of the combinatorial regulation between miRNAs and genes.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2016.2556744","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61402340,61379092,61422309,61171007); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China(grant numbers:2014CFB194); Outstanding Young Scientist Program of CAS; Key Laboratory of Random Complex Structures and Data Science, CAS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458909","$L_{0}$ -penalized singular value decomposition ( $L_{0}$ -SVD);miRNA cluster;miRNA-gene joint module;multiple-output sparse group lasso","Sparse matrices;Gene expression;Nanobioscience;Breast cancer;Linear regression;Biological system modeling","","10","","43","IEEE","25 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A conventional method to compute protein structure dissimilarity requires structural alignment of the proteins.

In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure for protein structure comparisons using a set of multi-view 2D images of 3D protein structures. In this approach, each protein structure is represented by a subspace from the image set. The similarity between two protein structures is then characterized by the canonical angles between the two subspaces. The primary advantage of our method is that precise alignment is not needed. We employed Grassmann Discriminant Analysis (GDA) as the subspace-based learning in the classification framework. We applied our method for the classification problem of seven SCOP structural classes of protein 3D structures. The proposed method outperformed the k-nearest neighbor method (k-NN) based on conventional alignment-based methods CE, FATCAT, and TM-align.

Shallow marine systems, particularly coral reefs, are under significant pressures due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other anthropogenic pressures, leading to rapid, often devastating changes, in these fragile and diverse ecosystems. Historically, remote sensing of shallow marine habitats has been limited to meter-scale imagery due to the optical effects of ocean wave distortion, refraction, and optical attenuation. NeMO-Net combines 3D cm-scale distortion-free imagery captured using NASA's airborne FluidCam and fluid lensing remote sensing technology with low resolution airborne and spaceborne datasets of varying spatial resolutions, spectral spaces, calibrations, and temporal cadence in a supercomputer-based deep learning framework. NeMO-Net augments and improves the benthic habitat classification accuracy of low-resolution datasets across large geographic and temporal scales using high-resolution training data from FluidCam. NeMO-Net's FCNN uses ResNet and RefineNet to perform semantic segmentation and cloud masking of remote sensing imagery of shallow marine systems from drones, manned aircraft, and satellites, including FluidCam, WorldView, Planet, Sentinel, and Landsat. Deep Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Networks (LapSRN) alongside Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) are used to augment low resolution imagery with high resolution drone-based datasets as well as recognize domain-invariant features across multiple instruments to achieve high classification accuracies, ameliorating inter-sensor spatial, spectral and temporal heterogeneities.

Traditional fuzzers, which primarily rely on code coverage as a metric, are inadequate for discovering diverse exploitable heap states. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzing technique that utilizes heap manipulation diversity as principle to explore various exploitable heap states. We implemented our prototype, HMFuzz, and the evaluation shows that it effectively transforms a Proof of Concept (PoC) into multiple exploitable PoCs.

The control devices are interconnected via modern control communication bus such as ModbusTCP which now leverages Ethernet to allow interoperability between different solutions and vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers. This presentation discusses diversified redundant architecture as a cyber-resilient system for networked control devices which maintains their normal operation even under compromised situations. This operation-based resilient architecture adds an isolated device, functionally equivalent to the networked primary device but with essential safe-mode operation features only, which is naturally immune to cyber incidents. In addition, a supervisor component monitors the operation of both networked and isolated devices, and transfers control to the safe-mode isolated device if the networked device operates abnormally, assuming that the abnormal operation is resulted from malicious hacking which has not been detected from the network cyber security defense. However, even with its resiliency, the diversified architecture has its own blind side — unawareness of presence of hacking traffic on the control bus when operational changes are not made by the hackers. Therefore, to solve this problem of unawareness of and undetected intrusion, we improve the architecture with an additional feature of intrusion detection utilizing open source software called Snort. The security features of Snort are incorporated as an intrusion detection and awareness solution, and are customized into the supervisor component of the diversified architecture for Modbus TCP/IP traffic monitoring. In laboratory tests, the added feature of intrusion detection has successfully initiated a safe-mode control transfer to the isolated device upon detection of unusual data traffic on the control bus. With this bus monitoring and intrusion detection, the diversified architecture would become a truly resilient and secure networked industrial control system.","","978-1-908320-93-3","10.23919/ICITST.2017.8356331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8356331","","Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Control systems;Computer crime;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits","","","","","","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs), the feasibility of solutions should be considered as well. Then the real challenge of constrained many-objective optimization can be generalized to the balance among convergence, diversity, and feasibility. In this paper, a tri-goal evolution framework is proposed for CMaOPs. The proposed framework carefully designs two indicators for convergence and diversity, respectively, and converts the constraints into the third indicator for feasibility. Since the essential goal of constrained many-objective optimization is to balance convergence, diversity, and feasibility, the philosophy of the proposed framework matches the essential goal of constrained many-objective optimization well. Thus, it is natural to use the proposed framework to deal with CMaOPs. Further, the proposed framework is conceptually simple and easy to instantiate for constrained many-objective optimization. A variety of balance schemes and ranking methods can be used to achieve the balance among convergence, diversity and feasibility. Three typical instantiations of the proposed framework are then designed.

From the introduction of 3D scanning, which allowed the representation of real world or synthetic objects into the virtual world, hardware and software advances have seen tremendous progress. However, despite the continuous improvement of the new generation image sensors and acquisition techniques, the acquired data are often corrupted by the low-frequency noise, outliers, misalignment, missing data, and variations in point density. These effects are amplified if the low-cost sensors and hardware are being used (e.g., mobile devices); thus, the acquisition and communication cost per datum is driven to a minimum. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the ongoing efforts in geometry and signal processing, describing several models from a wide range of signal processing relevant tasks, such as robust principal component analysis, compressive sampling, and matrix completion. Various scalable architectures and optimization algorithms are analyzed and reviewed, revealing significant insights into the fundamental processing operations and the involved implementation tradeoffs.

A novel mechanism of similarity retrieval is proposed. Similarity measure between video sequences considering the spatio-temporal variation through consecutive frames is presented. For bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and the rich meaning that users desire to capture, video shots are analyzed and characterized by the high-level feature of motion activity in compressed domain. The extracted features of motion activity are further described by the 2D-histogram that is sensitive to the spatio-temporal variation of moving objects. In order to reduce the dimensions of feature vector space in sequence matching, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is exploited to map semantic features of consecutive frames to the frequency domain while retains the discriminatory information and preserves the Euclidean distance between feature vectors. Experiments are performed on MPEG-7 testing video streams, and the results of sequence matching show that a few DCT transformed coefficients are adequate and thus reveal the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism of video retrieval.","","0-7695-2031-6","10.1109/MMSE.2003.1254439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254439","","Object detection;Gunshot detection systems;Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Video sequences;Information retrieval;Spatial databases;Video compression;Motion analysis;Frequency domain analysis","","2","","13","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Microaneurysms (MAs), due to leakage from retina blood vessels, are the early signs of DR. However, automated MA detection is complicated because of the small size of MA lesions and the low contrast between the lesion and its retinal background. Recently deep learning (DL) strategies have been used for automatic feature extraction and classification problems, especially for image analysis. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a DL strategy, is presented for MA detection in fundus images. Small image patches are generated from the original fundus images. The SSAE learns high-level features from pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of MA. The high-level features learned by SSAE are fed into a classifier to categorize each image patch as MA or non-MA. The public benchmark DIARETDB is utilized to provide the training/testing data and ground truth. Among the 89 images, totally 2182 image patches with MA lesions, serve as positive data, and another 6230 image patches without MA lesions are generated by a randomly sliding window operation, to serve as negative data. Without any blood vessel removal or complicated preprocessing operations, SSAE learned directly from the raw image patches, and automatically extracted the distinguishing features to classify the patches using Softmax Classifier. By employing the fine-tuning operation, an improved F-measure 91.3% and an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) 96.2% were achieved using 10-fold cross-validation.","","978-1-5090-0943-5","10.1109/CHASE.2016.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545864","deep learning;stacked sparse autoencoder;feature representation;automated microaneurysm detection;diabetic retinopathy","Feature extraction;Conferences;Machine learning;Biomedical image processing;Lesions","","64","","7","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, existing middleware and tools provide little information to users as to the suitability of a given grid topology for a specific grid application. Instead, users generally use ad-hoc performance models to evaluate mappings of their applications to resource and network topologies. Grid application behavior alone is complex, and adding resource and network behavior makes the situation even worse. As a result, users typically employ nearly blind experimentation to find good deployments of their applications in each new grid environment. Only through actual deployment and execution can a user discovers if the mapping was a good one. Further, even after finding a good configuration, there is no basis to determine if a much better configuration has been missed. This approach slows effective grid application development and deployment. We present a richer methodology for evaluating grid software and diverse grid environments based on the MicroGrid grid online simulator. With the MicroGrid, users, grid researchers, or grid operators can define and simulate arbitrary collections of resources and networks. This allows study of an existing grid testbed under controlled conditions or even to study the efficacy of higher performance environments than are available today. Further, the MicroGrid supports direct execution of grid applications unchanged. These application can be written with MPI, C, C++, Perl, and/or Python and use the Globus middleware. This enables detailed and accurate study of application behavior. This work presents: (1) the first validation of the MicroGrid for studying whole-program performance of MPI grid applications and (2) a demonstration of the MicroGrid as a tool for predicting the performance of applications on a range of grid resources and novel network topologies.","","0-7695-2115-0","10.1109/CLADE.2004.1309092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1309092","","Predictive models;Intelligent networks;Middleware;Application software;Network topology;Vehicle dynamics;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Computer science;Supercomputers","","4","1","32","IEEE","6 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, different perception systems have been proposed for different robotic platforms in order to detect high-level features such as facial expressions and body gestures. However, due to the variety of robotics software architectures and hardware platforms, these highly customized solutions are hardly interchangeable and adaptable to different HRI contexts. In addition, most of the developed systems have one issue in common: they detect features without awareness of the real-world contexts (e.g., detection of environmental sound assuming that it belongs to a person who is speaking, or treating a face printed on a sheet of paper as belonging to a real subject). This paper presents a novel social perception system (SPS) that has been designed to address the previous issues. SPS is an out-of-the-box system that can be integrated into different robotic platforms irrespective of hardware and software specifications. SPS detects, tracks, and delivers in real-time to robots, a wide range of human- and environment- relevant features with the awareness of their real-world contexts. We tested SPS in a typical scenario of HRI for the following purposes: to demonstrate the system capability in detecting several high-level perceptual features as well as to test the system capability to be integrated into different robotics platforms. Results show the promising capability of the system in perceiving real world in different social robotics platforms, as tested in two humanoid robots, i.e., FACE and ZENO.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2016.2598423","European Commission under the 7th Framework Program Projects Expressive Agents for Symbiotic Education and Learning(grant numbers:611971-FP7-ICT-2013-10); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7534850","Context-aware social perception;humanoid social robots;human–robot interaction (HRI);meta-scene;platform-independent system;scene analysis","Feature extraction;Robot sensing systems;Face recognition;Context awareness;Cameras;Human-robot interaction;Image analysis","","27","","52","IEEE","5 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the critical issues is to conduct many trials and errors in developing a DL model that usually serves as the major component of such a system. A major reason for this inefficiency is the progress of gradual reduction of the gap between the DL model under training and the ground truths. Prior techniques commonly focus on optimizing such errors after the errors have formed. They are insensitive to how a training dataset is provided to the DL model under training in batches, making their approaches nonproactive to deal with such errors. In this article, we propose DeepEutaxy, the first work to repair the model convergence problem from the batch prioritization perspective. Our key insight is that increasing the diversity (i.e., dissimilarity) of the corresponding weights of complex DL models before and after each training step can make the models learn faster and optimize the training errors quicker. DeepEutaxy first trains a DL model with several epochs for initialization. It then partitions and continually prioritizes the training batches for subsequent training epochs based on our novel notion of diversity between the pair of models before and after training on each batch, capturing the strength of the search direction to deal with training errors impacted by that batch. The experiment on six DL models over the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets shows that DeepEutaxy can accelerate the convergence of DL models on these two datasets with speedups of 1.75-8.45 and 2.67-15.15 times with respect to the training and test accuracies, respectively. DeepEutaxy can also be integrated into the existing techniques and compare favorably with the prior art in the experiment.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2021.3086189","GRF of Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:11214116,11200015); HKSAR ITF(grant numbers:ITS/378/18); CityU SRG(grant numbers:7004882,7005216,7005122,9678180); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460310","Accuracy improvement;debug;deep learning (DL) models;efficiency;error reduction;fixing;model convergence","Training;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Data models;Neurons;Convergence","","","","50","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector is constructed.

These include: 1) heavy-tail flight and pause-time distributions; 2) heterogeneously bounded mobility areas of individuals; and 3) truncated power-law intercontact times. This paper reports two additional such features: a) The destinations of people (or we say waypoints) are dispersed in a self-similar manner; and b) people are more likely to choose a destination closer to its current waypoint. These features are known to be influential to the performance of human-assisted mobility networks. The main contribution of this paper is to present a mobility model called Self-similar Least-Action Walk (SLAW) that can produce synthetic mobility traces containing all the five statistical features in various mobility settings including user-created virtual ones for which no empirical information is available. Creating synthetic traces for virtual environments is important for the performance evaluation of mobile networks as network designers test their networks in many diverse network settings. A performance study of mobile routing protocols on top of synthetic traces created by SLAW shows that SLAW brings out the unique performance features of various routing protocols.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2172984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075290","Delay-tolerant network;human mobility;Levy walk;mobile ad hoc network;mobile network;mobility model","Humans;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Global Positioning System;Performance evaluation;Routing","","131","","50","IEEE","10 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, a file in the collection can be (further) compressed by identifying common strings within the file itself. At the cost of decompression latency, but a possible gain in compression effectiveness, an LZ-style within-file compressor could resolve these references to other files. To quantify the compression gain, we experiment with a variety of file collections, from emails to source code, and test against multiple measures. If the LZ scheme honors the inter-file references, then there is only minimal improvement. If the LZ algorithm replaces inter-file references with intra-file references, then up to 3% compression improvement is witnessed for mildly similar files, and over 200% improvement for highly similar files.","2379-7703","978-1-4799-5057-7","10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906778","Differential compression;LZ factorization","Electronic mail;Encoding;Dictionaries;Encyclopedias;Indexes;Measurement;Compression algorithms","","3","","18","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, in music field, the plagiarism is a controversial and debated phenomenon that has to do with the huge amount of money that music is able to generate. However, the existing mechanisms for plagiarism detection mainly apply superficial and brute-force string matching techniques. Such well-known metrics, widely used to discover similarities in text documents, cannot work well in discovering similarities in music compositions. Despite the wide-spread belief that few notes in common between two songs is enough to decide whether a plagiarism exists, the analysis of similarities is a very complex process. In this work, we provide novel perspectives in the field of automatic music plagiarism detection, and specifically, we propose an approach based on a fuzzy vectorial-based similarity. Given a suspicious melody, our approach envisions three steps: (1) its transformation in a vectorial representation, (2) retrieving of a list of similar melodies, (3) analysis and comparison with this subset of associated similar scores by using a fuzzy degree of similarity, that varies in a range between 0 for melodies that are fully musically different, and 1 for identical melodies. To assess the effectiveness of our system we performed tests on a large dataset of ascertained plagiarisms.

However, it is a quite challenging problem due to the subtle interclass difference and large intraclass variation. Recently, visual attention models have been applied to automatically localize the discriminative regions of an image for better capturing critical difference, which have demonstrated promising performance. Unfortunately, without consideration of the diversity in attention process, most of existing attention models perform poorly in classifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we propose a diversified visual attention network (DVAN) to address the problem of fine-grained object classification, which substantially relieves the dependency on strongly supervised information for learning to localize discriminative regions compared with attention-less models. More importantly, DVAN explicitly pursues the diversity of attention and is able to gather discriminative information to the maximal extent. Multiple attention canvases are generated to extract convolutional features for attention. An LSTM recurrent unit is employed to learn the attentiveness and discrimination of attention canvases. The proposed DVAN has the ability to attend the object from coarse to fine granularity, and a dynamic internal representation for classification is built up by incrementally combining the information from different locations and scales of the image. Extensive experiments conducted on CUB-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars datasets have demonstrated that the pro-posed DVAN achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, without using any prior knowledge, user interaction, or external resource in training and testing.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2648498","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61373121,61328205); Program for Sichuan Provincial Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:13QNJJ0149); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201507000032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7807286","Deep learning;fine-grained object classification;long-short-term-memory (LSTM);visual attention","Visualization;Feature extraction;Birds;Predictive models;Diversity reception;Dogs;Training","","325","","55","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present fast and globally convergent algorithms for estimating the three-parameter generalized gamma distribution (G Gamma D). The proposed method is based on novel scale-independent shape estimation (SISE) equations. We show that the SISE equations have a unique global root in their semi-infinite domains and the probability that the sample SISE equations have a unique global root tends to one. The consistency of the global root, its scale, and index shape estimators is obtained. Furthermore, we establish that, with probability tending to one, Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithms for solving the sample SISE equations converge globally to the unique root from any initial value in its given domain. In contrast to existing methods, another remarkable novelty is that the sample SISE equations are completely independent of gamma and polygamma functions and involve only elementary mathematical operations, making the algorithms well suited for real-time both hardware and software implementations. The SISE estimators also allow the maximum likelihood (ML) ratio procedure to be carried out for testing the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) versus the G Gamma D. Finally, the fast global convergence and accuracy of our algorithms for finite samples are demonstrated by both simulation studies and real image analysis.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2008.926148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4553725","Consistency;convexity;fast and globally convergent algorithms;fixed-point;generalized gamma distribution;image analysis and coding;scale-independent shape estimation;unique global root","Image converters;Signal processing;Image processing;Equations;Shape;Maximum likelihood estimation;Statistical distributions;Probability;Software algorithms;Hardware","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Statistical Distributions","58","2","25","IEEE","27 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recently proposed stable matching-based selection provides a new perspective to handle this balance under the framework of decomposition multiobjective optimization. In particular, the one-one stable matching between subproblems and solutions, which achieves an equilibrium between their mutual preferences, is claimed to strike a balance between convergence and diversity. However, the original stable marriage model has a high risk of matching a solution with an unfavorable subproblem, which finally leads to an imbalanced selection result. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incomplete preference lists into the stable matching model to remedy the loss of population diversity. In particular, each solution is only allowed to maintain a partial preference list consisting of its favorite subproblems. We implement two versions of stable matching-based selection mechanisms with incomplete preference lists: one achieves a two-level one-one matching and the other obtains a many-one matching. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is developed to automatically set the length of the incomplete preference list for each solution according to its local competitiveness.

In this paper we propose SCS, a novel method for measuring the similarity between categorical sequences, based on an original pattern matching scheme that makes it possible to capture chronological and non-chronological dependencies. SCS captures significant patterns that represent the natural structure of sequences, and reduces the influence of those representing noise. It constitutes an effective approach for measuring the similarity of data such as biological sequences, natural language texts and financial transactions.

Three use cases are presented in order to showcase the potential benefits. By the use of a user-space AP, which works in coordination with a controller, the network is able to assign each connected station to the AP that best fits with its characteristics. The system also manages security, avoiding the need of adding specific elements for authentication, encryption or decryption. Extensions are proposed to an existing protocol that defines the communication between the AP and the controller, in order to communicate and store the specific characteristics of each AP and end device. This includes new association and handoff schemes that do not introduce any additional delay. The system has been implemented in a real environment, and a battery of tests has been run using three hardware platforms of different characteristics. The results show that handoffs between bands are possible, and estimate the processing delays, the Round-Trip Time and the handoff delay, which is small enough in order not to produce any significant disruption to the user (10-50 ms).

However, a fundamental challenge is the typically small amount of data available due to the high costs and resources required for measurements. Small datasets limit the depth of DNNs implementable, and limit performance. In this work, a novel method for generating diversified radar micro-Doppler signatures using Kinect-based motion capture simulations is proposed as a training database for transfer learning with DNNs. In particular, it is shown that together with residual learning, the proposed DivNet approach allows for the construction of DNNs and offers improved performance in comparison to transfer learning from optical imagery. Furthermore, it is shown that initializing the network using diversified synthetic micro-Doppler signatures enables not only robust performance for previously unseen target profiles, but also class generalization.

More modern algorithms require large amounts of data to learn and use latent features from spectra for classification. Both approaches are computationally expensive, which is reflected in their power consumption, and require large amounts of user intervention to prepare. In this article, we introduce a low-power, neuromorphic algorithm for the real-time identification of radionuclides which simultaneously considers the entire shape of a gamma-ray spectrum. Utilizing the output of a traditional gamma-ray detector, our spiking, locally competitive algorithm uses sparse coding optimization to compare global patterns in a gamma-ray spectrum with a dictionary of radionuclide templates. This approach allows us to model informative global features resulting from both photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering. For the purpose of radiation threat reduction, the dictionary consists of data from the Nuclear Wallet Cards, a list of radionuclides and their properties compiled by the National Nuclear Data Center. To test our algorithm, we use a variety of gamma-ray spectra created using radionuclides measured under laboratory conditions with varying durations, distances, activity levels, and backgrounds, resulting in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. We have created test sets for three different gamma-ray detector types, with 57Co, 137Cs, 152Eu, 60Co, 239Pu, and 235U sources, to quantify the effect of resolution, efficiency, and background on the accuracy of the algorithm. We demonstrate a true positive accuracy of 91% with a high-resolution detector and 89% with a low-resolution detector on the corresponding test sets. Experimenting with the same radionuclides included in the test sets in a variety of special nuclear material (SNM) masking configurations, we show that our algorithm is capable of correctly identifying both SNM and mask even when the activity level of the mask is several times higher than that of the SNM. We also determine that our algorithm achieves over a 99% reduction in power consumption over other radionuclide identification software applications, which is critical for long-term, independent monitoring and is the goal of this research.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2021.3054608","Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)(grant numbers:HDTRA1-18-1-0009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9335987","Compton scatter;gamma-ray;identification;locally competitive algorithm (LCA);memristor;neuromorphic;power efficient;radionuclide;simple spiking LCA (SSLCA);sparse coding;spectrum;spiking architecture","Gamma-rays;Detectors;Software algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Shape","","3","","27","IEEE","26 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this challenge, in this article, we propose a new continual multiview task learning model that integrates deep matrix factorization and sparse subspace learning in a unified framework, which is termed deep continual multiview task learning (DCMvTL). More specifically, as a new multiview task arrives, DCMvTL first adopts a deep matrix factorization technique to capture hidden and hierarchical representations for this new coming multiview task while accumulating the fresh multiview knowledge in a layerwise manner. Then, a sparse subspace learning model is employed for the extracted factors at each layer and further reveals cross-view correlations via a self-expressive constraint. For model optimization, we derive a general multiview learning formulation when a new multiview task comes and apply an alternating minimization strategy to achieve lifelong learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DCMvTL model compared with the existing state-of-the-art MTMV and lifelong multiview task learning models.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2977497","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61722311,U1613214,61821005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9037204","Deep matrix factorization;lifelong machine learning;multiview learning;sparse subspace learning","Task analysis;Sparse matrices;Machine learning;Matrix decomposition;Correlation;Data models;Learning systems","","31","","44","IEEE","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to perform precise and efficient representation learning on such HiDS interactions data is a hot yet thorny issue. An efficient approach to it is latent factor analysis (LFA), which commonly depends on large-scale non-convex optimization. Hence, it is vital to implement an LFA model able to approximate second-order stationary points efficiently for enhancing its representation learning ability. However, existing second-order LFA models suffer from high computational cost, which significantly reduces its practicability. To address this issue, this paper presents a Momentum-accelerated Hessian-vector algorithm (MH) for precise and efficient LFA on HiDS data. Its main ideas are two-fold: a) adopting the principle of a Hessian-vector-product-based method to utilize the second-order information without manipulating a Hessian matrix directly, and b) incorporating a generalized momentum method into its parameter learning scheme for accelerating its convergence rate to a stationary point. Experimental results on nine industrial datasets demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art LFA models, an MH-based LFA model achieves gains in both accuracy and convergence rate. These positive outcomes also indicate that a generalized momentum method is compatible with the algorithms, e.g., a second-order algorithm, which implicitly rely on gradients.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3177316","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102086); Guangdong Province Universities and College Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515111058); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M683293); CAAIHuawei MindSpore Open Fund(grant numbers:CAAIXSJLJJ-2021-035A); Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciencias e da Tecnologia(grant numbers:0047/2021/A1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785520","Services computing;service application;recommendation service;high-dimensional and sparse data;machine learning;representation learning;latent factor analysis;hessian-vector;second-order optimization;generalized momentum method","Computational modeling;Approximation algorithms;Convergence;Analytical models;Symbols;Representation learning;Optimization","","17","","62","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a Raft implementation, i.e., gRaft, that enables precise auto scaling on spot markets. gRaft extends Raft with the following abstractions: (1) secretaries which relieve log processing from leader nodes and (2) observers which relieve read requests from followers. These abstractions are stateless, allowing for elastic auto scaling, even with unreliable spot instances. gRaft preserves strong consistency guarantees provided by Raft. We set up and tested gRaft with multiple auto scaling techniques using traces from Google. gRaft scales in resource footprint increments 5-7X smaller than Multi-Raft, the state of the art.

The method and its application are described in detail, and demonstrated with case studies that are implemented on an NVIDIA Tegra K1 System On Chip (SoC). The experimental results show execution time improvements in the range of 65 % -78% for several applications. SPVI also lifts restrictions required by other MDP solver approaches, making it more widely compatible with large classes of optimization problems.","","978-1-5386-8237-1","10.1109/DASIP.2018.8596969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8596969","Markov decision processes;MDP;GPU;CUDA;Value iteration;Sparsity","Acceleration;Signal processing algorithms;Graphics processing units;Data structures;Parallel processing;Signal processing;Linear algebra","","10","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Sparse tableau relaxation for the optimal power flow problem","B. Park; C. L. DeMarco","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA","2017 55th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","18 Jan 2018","2017","","","315","323","Optimal power flow (OPF) approaches employing such methods as semi-definite programming have garnered considerable interest in the literature of the last decade. The OPF formulations for these approaches have almost universally relied on Ybus admittance matrix representations, which derive from nodal analysis, and restrict allowable network elements to be voltage-controlled only. Limitations of nodal analysis long been recognized, and to overcome these, commercial power system software often employs modified nodal analysis (MNA). However, with OPF requiring many monitored links with constrained flows, the work here argues for a formulation even more versatile than MNA: Sparse Tableau Formulation (STF) of network constraints, with multi-port representation of individual components. The vast majority of transmission network components (e.g., transmission lines, transformers) have multi-port voltage-current behavior that is well-modelled as linear. Therefore, nonlinearities appear only in equations associated with generation and load at each bus. Utilizing STF, these sources of nonconvexity are confined to constraints local to each bus. This opens the door to simple, engineering-based convex relaxations. We introduce a constant current source at each bus, with these sources' values bounded in a manner that contains any feasible current produced by the actual generator or load model. The tightness of the relaxation is shown to improve when angle constraints are provided, and a DCOPF-based heuristic method is proposed to obtain such angle bounds.","","978-1-5386-3266-6","10.1109/ALLERTON.2017.8262754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8262754","","Mathematical model;Ports (Computers);Power transmission lines;Circuit breakers;Reactive power;Programming","","5","","30","IEEE","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analog joystick inputs are subject to black-box transformations which may produce intuitive and adaptable motion control for human operators, but complicate robotic control approaches; furthermore, installation of standard axle mounted odometers on a commercial PWC is difficult. In this work, we present an integrated hardware and software system for predicting the motion of a commercial PWC platform that does not require any physical or electronic modification of the chair beyond plugging into an industry standard auxiliary input port. This system uses an RGB-D camera and an Arduino interface board to capture motion data, including visual odometry and joystick signals, via ROS communication. Future motion is predicted using an autoregressive sparse Gaussian process model. We evaluate the proposed system on real-world short-term path prediction experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy when compared to a baseline neural network model.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-3081-5","10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460502","","Cameras;Gaussian processes;Robot sensing systems;Wheelchairs;Mobile robots;Hardware","","2","","28","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, MIMO communication using large dimensions has not been implemented for commercial systems. But the potential capacity of MIMO is much more significant when the MIMO dimensions become large. The hold-up is not just the shortfall in understanding how to deploy large-dimension MIMO, but also how to design the antenna systems. There is no widely agreed method for evaluating MEAs used by MIMO communications. Even the performance evaluation of a well-established MIMO configuration, such as the small scale systems already used, remains limited. The evaluation often defers to OTA tests in artificial environmental conditions. The real-world performance remains unclear, so care must be taken in design optimization. In this paper, we discuss the incorporation of some physical modeling of the propagation environment to evaluating the MEA performance for a typical urban wireless channel. A ray-optic method is applicable to any 3D environment, and any number of antennas with arbitrary patterns. In this sense it offers a practical approach for large-dimension MIMO evaluation by being able to change the antennas and the environment, all in software. The evaluation method is illustrated by using an MEA slot cube (12 antennas) operating in a specific environment, namely downtown Ottawa.","2164-3342","978-8-8907-0184-9","10.1109/EuCAP.2014.6902535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902535","physical modeling;ray-tracing;multiport antenna;MIMO;diversity gain;diversity combining","Diversity reception;MIMO;Antenna measurements;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas","","1","","18","","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
