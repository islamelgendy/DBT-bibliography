abstract = {Many practitioners in the software-intensive embedded industry often face difficulties after beginning their careers due to misalignment of the skills learned at the university with what is required in the workplace. Companies spend crucial resources to train personnel whose academic backgrounds are not only based on “computing disciplines” but also on non-computing ones. Analyzing the gap between the software industry and academia is important for three reasons: (1) for employers, hiring properly trained practitioners allows them to spend less time in training them while incorporating them more efficiently into the workforce; (2) for practitioners, knowing the most important skillset is helpful to increase their chance of employability; and (3) for academia, understanding the necessary skillset is critical to making curriculum changes. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey that yielded responses from 659 software professionals working worldwide in different roles. In this study, we only included the responses of 393 embedded software practitioners whose undergraduate degree was completed in Turkey, working in 10 countries. This article sheds light on the most important skills in the embedded software industry by presenting various cross-factor analyses. Understanding the coverage of these skills in the curriculum (mostly in Turkish universities) helps bridge the gaps, which can and should be achieved through more Industry Academia Collaborations (IACs).},

Considering that layout decomposition may generate plenty of solutions with diverse printabilities, relying on conventional mask optimization process to select the best candidates for manufacturing is computationally expensive. Therefore, an accurate and efficient printability estimation is crucial and can significantly accelerate the layout decomposition and mask optimization (LDMO) process. In this paper, we propose a CNN based prediction and integrate it into our new high performance LDMO framework. We also develop both the layout and the decomposition sampling strategies to facilitate the network training. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

The evaluation of dynamic Web pages is a problem still unsolved in the field of automatic evaluation tools, since the current evaluators are only able to evaluate static Web pages. Stone and Dhiensa have addressed this problem, and proposed a method for evaluating the accessibility of dynamic Web pages using a generalized page which contains all possible outputs that can be generated by a script. In this paper, we present another approach for evaluating the accessibility of dynamic Web pages generated using XML and XSLT. The approach consists of analysing an XSLT using a structure descriptor such as DTD or XSD to determine the different types of XML documents that can be generated. The strength of the presented approach is given by the fact that the use of XML features enhances the results gathered from automatic accesibility evaluation of dynamic Web pages.},

However, the inherent attributes of resistance to change are not entirely clear, for instance: its effects as well as actions to mitigate its occurrence. Objective: We aim to investigate potential causes and effects of resistance to change as well as conducts that can mitigate its occurrence on software processes improvement initiatives. Method: We performed a qualitative study in which we interviewed 21 practitioners and specialists in software process improvement. Results: We have identified 32 causes, 16 effects, and 29 conducts related to resistance to change. For instance, resistant senior management can sabotage the process by creating resistance to other stakeholders who want to implement improvements. Conclusion: We found that resistance to change in software process improvement initiatives also includes resistance to follow the processes. A significant part of the conducts comprises preventive and low-cost actions. Additionally, the results pointed out situations in which given conduct to mitigate resistance can generate other positive impacts like collaborative work fostering continuous improvements. Also, we observed that individuals are more affected by resistance to change than the projects. Our findings and their interconnections expose a diverse set of circumstances that can be explored to help achieve the objectives of a software process improvement initiative.},

abstract = {The functional scope of today's software-defined data centers (SDDC) has expanded to such an extent that servers face a growing amount of critical background operational tasks like load monitoring, logging, migration, and duplication, etc. These ancillary operations, which we refer to as management operations, often nibble the stringent data center power envelope and exert a tremendous amount of pressure on front-end user tasks. However, existing power capping, peak shaving, and time shifting mechanisms mainly focus on managing data center power demand at the "macro level" -- they do not distinguish ancillary background services from user tasks, and therefore often incur significant performance degradation and energy overhead.In this study we explore "micro-level" power management in SDDC: tuning a specific set of critical loads for the sake of overall system efficiency and performance. Specifically, we look at management operations that can often lead to resource contention and energy overhead in an IaaS SDDC. We assess the feasibility of this new power management paradigm by characterizing the resource and power impact of various management operations. We propose HOPE, a new system optimization framework for eliminating the potential efficiency bottleneck caused by the management operations in the SDDC. HOPE is implemented on a customized OpenStack cloud environment with heavily instrumented power infrastructure. We thoroughly validate HOPE models and optimization efficacy under various user workload scenarios. Our deployment experiences show that the proposed technique allows SDDC to reduce energy consumption by 19%, reduce management operation execution time by 25.4%, and in the meantime improve workload performance by 30%.},

Through an investigation on premiere software engineering venues, we identify and discuss 12 contributions that can be further instantiated in refactoring tools used to improve software energy efficiency --- and the challenges behind this process. These opportunities span a wide range of software characteristics, such as mobile applications and concurrent programming. Mobile applications is the topic with the greatest number of opportunities (6 out of 11).

isbn = {9781595936493},

abstract = {Testing a database engine has been and continues to be a challenging task. The space of possible SQL queries along with their possible access paths is practically unbounded. Moreover, this space is continuously increasing in size as the feature set of modern DBMS systems expands with every product release. To tackle these problems, random query generator tools have been used to create large numbers of test cases. While such test case generators enable the creation of complex and syntactically correct SQL queries, they do not guarantee that the queries produced return results or exercise desired DBMS components. Very often the generated queries contain logical contradictions, which cause "short-circuits" at the query optimization layer, failing to exercise the lower layers of the database engine (query optimization, query execution, access methods, etc.)In this paper we present a random test case generation technique, which provides solutions to the above problems. Our technique utilizes execution feedback, obtained from the DBMS under test, in order to guide the test generation process toward specific DBMS subcomponents and rarely exercised code paths. Test cases are created incrementally using a genetic approach, which synthesizes query characteristics that are of interest for the purposes of test coverage. Our experiments indicate that our technique can outperform other methods of random testing in terms of efficiency and code coverage. We also provide experimental results which show that the use of execution feedback improves code coverage of specific DBMS components. Finally, we share our experiences gained from using this testing approach during the development cycles of Microsoft SQL Server.},
